Abstract: Masked Face Recognition (MFR) is an increasingly important area in biometric
recognition technologies, especially with the widespread use of masks as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This development has created new challenges
for facial recognition systems due to the partial concealment of basic facial
features. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the latest

changes in lighting, different facial positions, partial concealment, and the
impact of mask types on the performance of systems. It also reviews advanced
technologies developed to overcome these challenges, including data enhancement
using artificial databases and multimedia methods to improve the ability of
systems to generalize. In addition, the paper highlights advance in deep
network design, feature extraction techniques, evaluation criteria, and data
sets used in this area. Moreover, it reviews the various applications of masked
face recognition in the fields of security and medicine, highlighting the
growing importance of these systems in light of recurrent health crises and
increasing security threats. Finally, the paper focuses on future research
trends such as developing more efficient algorithms and integrating multimedia
technologies to improve the performance of recognition systems in real-world
environments and expand their applications.

### [3] [HoneyImage: Verifiable, Harmless, and Stealthy Dataset Ownership Verification for Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00892)
*Zhihao Zhu,Jiale Han,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoneyImage是一种图像数据集所有权验证的新方法，通过在少量难样本中嵌入不可察觉的痕迹，实现在验证准确性与数据完整性之间的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多图像数据集包含敏感或专有内容，这对未经授权的数据使用提出了重要担忧。数据所有者需要可靠机制以验证其专有数据是否被第三方模型滥用。

Method: HoneyImage 选择性修改少量难样本，嵌入不可察觉但可验证的痕迹，实现可靠的所有权验证，同时保持数据集完整性。

Result: HoneyImage方法在四个基准数据集和多个模型架构上进行了广泛实验，能够始终实现较高的验证准确性，并尽量减少对下游性能的影响，同时保持不可察觉。

Conclusion: HoneyImage方法提供了一种实用机制，使数据所有者能够保护其有价值图像数据集的所有权，促进数据共享并充分发挥数据驱动AI的变革潜力。

Abstract: Image-based AI models are increasingly deployed across a wide range of
domains, including healthcare, security, and consumer applications. However,
many image datasets carry sensitive or proprietary content, raising critical
concerns about unauthorized data usage. Data owners therefore need reliable
mechanisms to verify whether their proprietary data has been misused to train
third-party models. Existing solutions, such as backdoor watermarking and
membership inference, face inherent trade-offs between verification
effectiveness and preservation of data integrity. In this work, we propose
HoneyImage, a novel method for dataset ownership verification in image
recognition models. HoneyImage selectively modifies a small number of hard
samples to embed imperceptible yet verifiable traces, enabling reliable
ownership verification while maintaining dataset integrity. Extensive
experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple model architectures
show that HoneyImage consistently achieves strong verification accuracy with
minimal impact on downstream performance while maintaining imperceptible. The
proposed HoneyImage method could provide data owners with a practical mechanism
to protect ownership over valuable image datasets, encouraging safe sharing and
unlocking the full transformative potential of data-driven AI.

### [4] [Phase-fraction guided denoising diffusion model for augmenting multiphase steel microstructure segmentation via micrograph image-mask pair synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00896)
*Hoang Hai Nam Nguyen,Minh Tien Tran,Hoheok Kim,Ho Won Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 引入PF-DiffSeg框架，通过合成微结构图像及其分割掩膜，提高了少数类分割准确性并减少推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在金属显微结构分割中的有效性常常受到缺乏人工标注相掩膜的限制，特别是对稀有或成分复杂的金属合金形态。

Method: 该研究介绍了PF-DiffSeg框架，此框架是一种一阶去噪扩散框架，通过生成性的轨迹合成微结构图像及其相应的分割掩膜，并通过全球相分数向量进行条件控制，增强了数据的多样性和训练效率。

Result: PF-DiffSeg方法与传统增强策略相比，在MicroDAM基准上的多相钢分割准确性得到显著提升，尤其是在少数类，并超过了两阶段掩膜引导的扩散和生成对抗网络基线。

Conclusion: PF-DiffSeg在合成微结构图像及其分割掩膜方面，在少数类的分割准确性上表现出显著提升，优于传统的数据增强方法以及其他基线方法。同时，该方法还能减少推理时间。

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning in metallographic microstructure
segmentation is often constrained by the lack of human-annotated phase masks,
particularly for rare or compositionally complex morphologies within the metal
alloy. We introduce PF-DiffSeg, a phase-fraction controlled, one-stage
denoising diffusion framework that jointly synthesizes microstructure images
and their corresponding segmentation masks in a single generative trajectory to
further improve segmentation accuracy. By conditioning on global phase-fraction
vectors, augmented to represent real data distribution and emphasize minority
classes, our model generates compositionally valid and structurally coherent
microstructure image and mask samples that improve both data diversity and
training efficiency. Evaluated on the MetalDAM benchmark for additively
manufactured multiphase steel, our synthetic augmentation method yields notable
improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to standard augmentation
strategies especially in minority classes and further outperforms a two-stage
mask-guided diffusion and generative adversarial network (GAN) baselines, while
also reducing inference time compared to conventional approach. The method
integrates generation and conditioning into a unified framework, offering a
scalable solution for data augmentation in metallographic applications.

### [5] [Benefits of Feature Extraction and Temporal Sequence Analysis for Video Frame Prediction: An Evaluation of Hybrid Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00898)
*Jose M. Sánchez Velázquez,Mingbo Cai,Andrew Coney,Álvaro J. García- Tejedor,Alberto Nogales*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了混合深度学习方法改善视频帧预测性能，3DCNNs与ConvLSTMs结合表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能的进步促进了计算机视觉领域的发展，尤其是解决视频帧预测等复杂问题。

Method: 结合自编码器进行特征提取和使用RNN及3D CNN进行时间序列建模。

Result: 实验结果显示，所提出的方法能显著提高帧预测性能，SSIM指标从0.69提升到0.82。

Conclusion: 混合深度学习模型在视频帧预测中表现优异，尤其是使用3DCNNs和ConvLSTMs的模型。

Abstract: In recent years, advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly
impacted computer science, particularly in the field of computer vision,
enabling solutions to complex problems such as video frame prediction. Video
frame prediction has critical applications in weather forecasting or autonomous
systems and can provide technical improvements, such as video compression and
streaming. Among Artificial Intelligence methods, Deep Learning has emerged as
highly effective for solving vision-related tasks, although current frame
prediction models still have room for enhancement. This paper evaluates several
hybrid deep learning approaches that combine the feature extraction
capabilities of autoencoders with temporal sequence modelling using Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), and related
architectures. The proposed solutions were rigorously evaluated on three
datasets that differ in terms of synthetic versus real-world scenarios and
grayscale versus color imagery. Results demonstrate that the approaches perform
well, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid
models utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale
videos with real data are the easiest to predict.

### [6] [TESPEC: Temporally-Enhanced Self-Supervised Pretraining for Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00913)
*Mohammad Mohammadi,Ziyi Wu,Igor Gilitschenski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TESPEC是一种新的自监督预训练框架，能够利用长事件序列学习时空信息，在下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件预训练的自监督学习方法主要模仿RGB图像方法，忽略了事件的时间信息。因此需要一种既能处理事件的空间信息，又能处理事件的时间信息的框架。

Method: TESPEC采用掩码图像建模方式，并设计了一种将事件累积成伪灰度视频的新方法，其包含底层场景的高级语义信息，对传感器噪声具有鲁棒性，并降低运动模糊。

Result: TESPEC能够有效在预训练中利用长事件序列，为递归模型提供良好支持，体现了其优势。

Conclusion: 实验展示TESPEC在包括目标检测、语义分割和单目深度估计等下游任务中取得了最先进的结果。

Abstract: Long-term temporal information is crucial for event-based perception tasks,
as raw events only encode pixel brightness changes. Recent works show that when
trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward
models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained
weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts.
Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training
largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on
raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of
events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training
framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is
well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long
event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling
paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to
accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic
information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and
reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to
reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection,
semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation. Project webpage:

Conclusion: 该论文证明了基于扩散的方法在提高法证人脸识别性能上的可行性，特别是在面临低质量图像时，表现出显著的效果。

Abstract: Face recognition systems experience severe performance degradation when
processing low-quality forensic evidence imagery. This paper presents an
evaluation of latent diffusion-based enhancement for improving face recognition
under forensically relevant degradations. Using a dataset of 3,000 individuals
from LFW with 24,000 recognition attempts, we implement the Flux.1 Kontext Dev
pipeline with Facezoom LoRA adaptation to test against seven degradation
categories, including compression artefacts, blur effects, and noise
contamination. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements, increasing
overall recognition accuracy from 29.1% to 84.5% (55.4 percentage point
improvement, 95% CI: [54.1, 56.7]). Statistical analysis reveals significant
performance gains across all degradation types, with effect sizes exceeding
conventional thresholds for practical significance. These findings establish
the potential of sophisticated diffusion based enhancement in forensic face
recognition applications.

### [8] [Optimizing Vision-Language Consistency via Cross-Layer Regional Attention Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00945)
*Yifan Wang,Hongfeng Ai,Quangao Liu,Maowei Jiang,Ruiyuan Kang,Ruiqi Li,Jiahua Dong,Mengting Xiao,Cheng Jiang,Chenzhong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的注意力机制，通过协调层次和补丁注意力改善视觉语言模型性能，超越现有方法并增加解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）面临在跨模态嵌入学习中协调多样化注意力机制的挑战，导致注意力不匹配和性能不佳。

Method: 提出了一种一致的跨层区域对齐方法（CCRA），通过引入层-补丁式交叉注意（LPWCA）实现区域-语义细粒度相关性，同时联合调整补丁和层次嵌入。采用渐进式注意力整合（PAI）系统协调LPWCA、层次和补丁注意力机制，以确保从语义到区域的一致性。

Result: 在10个多样化的视觉语言基准测试中，CCRA增强的LLaVA-v1.5-7B模型实现了最先进的性能，以仅3.55百万额外参数超越所有基线方法。

Conclusion: CCRA通过更侧重区域和语义对齐的注意力模式提供了增强的解释性，同时避免了注意力漂移并最大化了单独注意力的效益。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) face challenges in effectively coordinating
diverse attention mechanisms for cross-modal embedding learning, leading to
mismatched attention and suboptimal performance. We propose Consistent
Cross-layer Regional Alignment (CCRA), which introduces Layer-Patch-wise Cross
Attention (LPWCA) to capture fine-grained regional-semantic correlations by
jointly weighting patch and layer-wise embedding, and Progressive Attention
Integration (PAI) that systematically coordinates LPWCA, layer-wise, and
patch-wise attention mechanisms in sequence. This progressive design ensures
consistency from semantic to regional levels while preventing attention drift
and maximizing individual attention benefits. Experimental results on ten
diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that our CCRA-enhanced
LLaVA-v1.5-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all
baseline methods with only 3.55M additional parameters, while providing
enhanced interpretability through more regionally focused and semantically
aligned attention patterns.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究表明，结合自动生成标签和少量手动注释数据集能够加速深度神经网络的应用场景转换，如从跑步机到自行车。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在将原有基于立体和多模态标签的方法从跑步机跑步转移到测功仪骑行中应用，以提升运动医学中红外热成像技术的性能。

Method: 采用自动标签进行训练语义分割网络，并使用少量高质量人工注释图像进行微调比较不同数据集组合。

Result: 使用少量人工数据进行微调足以提高深度神经网络的整体性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法可以加速深度神经网络适应新的应用场景，例如从跑步机到自行车的转换。

Abstract: Infrared thermography is emerging as a powerful tool in sports medicine,
allowing assessment of thermal radiation during exercise and analysis of
anatomical regions of interest, such as the well-exposed calves. Building on
our previous advanced automatic annotation method, we aimed to transfer the
stereo- and multimodal-based labeling approach from treadmill running to
ergometer cycling. Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network
with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images
has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results
indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to
improve the overall performance of the deep neural network. Finally, combining
automatically generated labels with small manually annotated data sets
accelerates the adaptation of deep neural networks to new use cases, such as
the transition from treadmill to bicycle.

*Cihang Peng,Qiming Hou,Zhong Ren,Kun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROVI是一个高质量的合成数据集，增强了实例定位精度和图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创建一个高质量的实例定位文本到图像生成的合成数据集，以解决现有数据集类别有限的问题。

Method: 使用重标注策略，在预检测阶段通过视觉语言模型生成全面的视觉描述，并由大语言模型处理以提取潜在类别列表，通过开放词汇检测器进行检测。

Result: 用于训练GLIGEN模型，该模型在实例定位准确性、提示忠实度和美学质量方面优于现有的先进替代方案。

Conclusion: ROVI数据集在图像质量和分辨率方面超过了现有检测数据集，并包含更多类别。使用该数据集训练的模型在实例定位、提示忠实度和美学质量方面表现优异。

Abstract: We present ROVI, a high-quality synthetic dataset for instance-grounded
text-to-image generation, created by labeling 1M curated web images. Our key
innovation is a strategy called re-captioning, focusing on the pre-detection
stage, where a VLM (Vision-Language Model) generates comprehensive visual
descriptions that are then processed by an LLM (Large Language Model) to
extract a flat list of potential categories for OVDs (Open-Vocabulary
Detectors) to detect. This approach yields a global prompt inherently linked to
instance annotations while capturing secondary visual elements humans typically
overlook. Evaluations show that ROVI exceeds existing detection datasets in
image quality and resolution while containing two orders of magnitude more
categories with an open-vocabulary nature. For demonstrative purposes, a
text-to-image model GLIGEN trained on ROVI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives in instance grounding accuracy, prompt fidelity,
and aesthetic quality. Our dataset and reproducible pipeline are available at
https://github.com/CihangPeng/ROVI.

### [11] [AutoSIGHT: Automatic Eye Tracking-based System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01015)
*Byron Dowling,Jozef Probcin,Adam Czajka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究通过AutoSIGHT系统分析眼动数据，以区分专家和非专家的视觉任务解决水平，通过虹膜检测任务验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人员研究如何通过机器自动评估人类在视觉任务解决中的专业水平。

Method: 提出了一种自动评估系统AutoSIGHT，从眼动数据中提取特征并对专家与非专家进行分类。

Result: 在虹膜展示攻击检测任务中，AutoSIGHT在5秒评估窗口下，平均ROC曲线下面积为0.751；而在30秒评估窗口下，曲线面积提升至0.8306。

Conclusion: 使用眼动特征评估人类在视觉任务上的专业程度是可行的，并为人机协作的新研究方向提供了可能性。

Abstract: Can we teach machines to assess the expertise of humans solving visual tasks
automatically based on eye tracking features? This paper proposes AutoSIGHT,
Automatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies
expert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features
extracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual
task. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for
this study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds,
AutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of
0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is
viable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is
available, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating
the model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly
delayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate
the automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing
setups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution
between the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or
the task at hand changes rapidly). Along with this paper, we offer the eye
tracking data used in this study collected from 6 experts and 53 non-experts
solving iris PAD visual task.

*Muhammad Zeeshan,Umer Zaki,Syed Ahmed Pasha,Zaar Khizar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文详细介绍了增量式运动结构（SfM）实现，通过真实数据集验证其在稀疏3D重建中的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从非结构化图像集合中进行准确的3D重建，对于机器人技术、地图绘制和场景理解等应用至关重要。

Method: 提出增量式运动结构（SfM）管道的详细实现，着重于几何估计的一致性以及通过捆绑调整进行迭代优化的效果。

Result: 使用真实数据集展示该方法，并通过重投影误差和相机轨迹一致性评估重建质量。结果表明增量式SfM在视觉结构化环境中进行稀疏3D重建是现实可行的可靠方法。

Conclusion: 增量式SfM提供了一个灵活的替代方案，可以在稀疏或部分重叠的数据集中恢复场景结构和相机运动。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from unstructured image collections is a key
requirement in applications such as robotics, mapping, and scene understanding.
While global Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques rely on full image
connectivity and can be sensitive to noise or missing data, incremental SfM
offers a more flexible alternative. By progressively incorporating new views
into the reconstruction, it enables the system to recover scene structure and
camera motion even in sparse or partially overlapping datasets. In this paper,
we present a detailed implementation of the incremental SfM pipeline, focusing
on the consistency of geometric estimation and the effect of iterative
refinement through bundle adjustment. We demonstrate the approach using a real
dataset and assess reconstruction quality through reprojection error and camera
trajectory coherence. The results support the practical utility of incremental
SfM as a reliable method for sparse 3D reconstruction in visually structured
environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CT扫描检查次数的增加，需要自动化方法帮助放射科医生应对越来越大的工作量。

Method: 提出了一种新的基于图的方法，将CT扫描建模为结构化图，利用轴向切片三重节点通过频谱域卷积处理。

Result: 方法表现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力，具有竞争力的性能，并在z轴平移方面表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过消融研究评估了每个提出组件的贡献，验证了该方法在多标签异常分类任务中提升了性能。

Abstract: With the increasing number of CT scan examinations, there is a need for
automated methods such as organ segmentation, anomaly detection and report
generation to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D CT scans remains a critical yet challenging
task due to the complex spatial relationships within volumetric data and the
variety of observed anomalies. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional
networks have limited abilities to model long-range dependencies while Vision
Transformers suffer from high computational costs and often require extensive
pre-training on large-scale datasets from the same domain to achieve
competitive performance. In this work, we propose an alternative by introducing
a new graph-based approach that models CT scans as structured graphs,
leveraging axial slice triplets nodes processed through spectral domain
convolution to enhance multi-label anomaly classification performance. Our
method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, and competitive
performance while achieving robustness to z-axis translation. An ablation study
evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的规避框架，通过教师模型和OOD数据集转移知识，能够有效规避DOV方法，同时揭示了当前DOV的关键漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放的世界中，数据盗窃无法完全防止，数据集所有权验证(DOV)成为保护版权的有前途方法。然而，规避DOV被视为非常具有挑战性的问题。我们识别到，之前的研究依赖于过于简单的规避攻击进行评估，导致了一种虚假的安全感。

Method: 我们的统一规避框架包括：首先一个教师模型从版权数据集中学习，然后使用一个分布外（OOD）的数据集作为中介，向一个替代学生模型转移任务相关但不含标识符的领域知识。通过利用视觉-语言模型和大语言模型，我们从OOD图库中策划出了信息最丰富、最可靠的子集作为最终转移集，并提出有选择地转移任务导向知识以在泛化和规避效能之间取得更好平衡。

Result: 实验表明，我们的方法在各种数据集上对十一种DOV方法均有效，消除了所有版权识别，并且在泛化和效能方面都显著超过最新的九种规避攻击，仅需中等的计算开销。

Conclusion: 我们的方法能够消除所有版权标识符，并在泛化和效能方面显著超过九种最新的规避攻击，同时保持适中计算开销。作为概念验证，我们揭示了当前DOV方法中的关键漏洞，突显了需要长期发展以增强其实用性。

Abstract: Modern over-parameterized deep models are highly data-dependent, with large
scale general-purpose and domain-specific datasets serving as the bedrock for
rapid advancements. However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive
information, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world
where data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification
(DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting
unauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its
diversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely
challenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied
on oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of
security. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model
first learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet
identifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an
out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging
Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most
informative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer
set, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a
better trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments
across diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach
simultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly
outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and
effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead. As a proof of concept, we
reveal key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, highlighting the need for
long-term development to enhance practicality.

Method: 引入DreamSat-2.0管道，通过自定义航天器和小行星数据集，对三种3D重建模型进行评估。采用2D感知和3D几何指标进行系统分析。

Result: Hunyuan-3D在航天器上获得最高感知评分，而在小行星上表现出最佳几何准确性。各模型的表现显得与领域相关。

Conclusion: 模型在复杂航天器上产生更高质量的图像，而在小行星上实现了更好的几何重建。此研究建立了新的基准，对以前的工作进行了显著的改进。

Abstract: To enhance asteroid exploration and autonomous spacecraft navigation, we
introduce DreamSat-2.0, a pipeline that benchmarks three state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction models-Hunyuan-3D, Trellis-3D, and Ouroboros-3D-on custom
spacecraft and asteroid datasets. Our systematic analysis, using 2D perceptual
(image quality) and 3D geometric (shape accuracy) metrics, reveals that model
performance is domain-dependent. While models produce higher-quality images of
complex spacecraft, they achieve better geometric reconstructions for the
simpler forms of asteroids. New benchmarks are established, with Hunyuan-3D
achieving top perceptual scores on spacecraft but its best geometric accuracy
on asteroids, marking a significant advance over our prior work.

Method: 提出COSTARR方法，通过结合熟悉特征的必要性和对不熟悉特征的缺乏，在开放集识别中更有效地检测新奇性。

Result: 实验表明，COSTARR在多种现代预训练架构中有效地推广，并在开放集识别能力上取得了显著的进展。

Conclusion: COSTARR方法在开放集识别中有效地利用了以前未被充分利用的衰减信息，显著超越了先前的最先进方法。

Abstract: Handling novelty remains a key challenge in visual recognition systems.
Existing open-set recognition (OSR) methods rely on the familiarity hypothesis,
detecting novelty by the absence of familiar features. We propose a novel
attenuation hypothesis: small weights learned during training attenuate
features and serve a dual role-differentiating known classes while discarding
information useful for distinguishing known from unknown classes. To leverage
this overlooked information, we present COSTARR, a novel approach that combines
both the requirement of familiar features and the lack of unfamiliar ones. We
provide a probabilistic interpretation of the COSTARR score, linking it to the
likelihood of correct classification and belonging in a known class. To
determine the individual contributions of the pre- and post-attenuated features
to COSTARR's performance, we conduct ablation studies that show both
pre-attenuated deep features and the underutilized post-attenuated Hadamard
product features are essential for improving OSR. Also, we evaluate COSTARR in
a large-scale setting using ImageNet2012-1K as known data and NINCO,
iNaturalist, OpenImage-O, and other datasets as unknowns, across multiple
modern pre-trained architectures (ViTs, ConvNeXts, and ResNet). The experiments
demonstrate that COSTARR generalizes effectively across various architectures
and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by incorporating
previously discarded attenuation information, advancing open-set recognition
capabilities.

significantly improve environmental compliance, operational safety, and public
health outcomes by enabling precise, automated monitoring of industrial
emissions.

TL;DR: 提出了Trans-Adapter以改善透明图像修复质量，并进行了广泛实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像修复方法仅适用于RGB图像，透明图像修复中传统方法难以保持透明度一致性且容易产生锯齿边缘。因此，需要一种能够直接处理透明图像的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种名为Trans-Adapter的插件适配器，使得基于扩散的图像修复模型能够直接处理透明图像，同时支持可控编辑。

Result: 通过引入LayerBench平台进行了大量实验，结果表明Trans-Adapter有效提升了透明图像修复的效果和边缘质量。

Conclusion: Trans-Adapter显著改善了透明图像修复中透明度的一致性和边缘质量，并且可以与多种模型集成以实现可控编辑。

Abstract: RGBA images, with the additional alpha channel, are crucial for any
application that needs blending, masking, or transparency effects, making them
more versatile than standard RGB images. Nevertheless, existing image
inpainting methods are designed exclusively for RGB images. Conventional
approaches to transparent image inpainting typically involve placing a
background underneath RGBA images and employing a two-stage process: image
inpainting followed by image matting. This pipeline, however, struggles to
preserve transparency consistency in edited regions, and matting can introduce
jagged edges along transparency boundaries. To address these challenges, we
propose Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter that enables diffusion-based
inpainting models to process transparent images directly. Trans-Adapter also
supports controllable editing via ControlNet and can be seamlessly integrated
into various community models. To evaluate our method, we introduce LayerBench,
along with a novel non-reference alpha edge quality evaluation metric for
assessing transparency edge quality. We conduct extensive experiments on
LayerBench to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Method: 引入密集几何指导，通过重建连续粒子轨迹，提供超越稀疏视觉线索的时间丰富运动约束。

Result: MASIV框架引入了可学习的神经本构模型，可以在不假设场景特定材料先验的情况下推断物体动态，解决了优化不稳定和物理上不合理行为的问题。

Conclusion: MASIV实现了在几何精度、渲染质量和泛化能力方面的先进性能。

Abstract: System identification from videos aims to recover object geometry and
governing physical laws. Existing methods integrate differentiable rendering
with simulation but rely on predefined material priors, limiting their ability
to handle unknown ones. We introduce MASIV, the first vision-based framework
for material-agnostic system identification. Unlike existing approaches that
depend on hand-crafted constitutive laws, MASIV employs learnable neural
constitutive models, inferring object dynamics without assuming a
scene-specific material prior. However, the absence of full particle state
information imposes unique challenges, leading to unstable optimization and
physically implausible behaviors. To address this, we introduce dense geometric
guidance by reconstructing continuum particle trajectories, providing
temporally rich motion constraints beyond sparse visual cues. Comprehensive
experiments show that MASIV achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric
accuracy, rendering quality, and generalization ability.

Motivation: 寻找增强图像编辑任务性能的方法，以便在多种编辑任务中表现出色。

Method: 使用自回归多模态模型来统一处理文本和视觉标记，并探索三种增强性能策略：监督微调（SFT）、强化学习（RL）和链式推理（CoT）。

Result: 研究发现强化学习（RL）与大型多模态LLM验证器结合是三种策略中最有效的。发布了一个名为EARL的强化学习驱动的图像编辑模型，该模型在各种编辑任务中表现优异，并且训练数据相对较少。

Conclusion: EARL促进了自回归多模态模型在图像编辑方面的发展，其效果与强大的基线模型相竞争，且消耗的训练数据更少。

Abstract: We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image
editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one
consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that
processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined
with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these
strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a
strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse
range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training
data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on
image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为UniEgoMotion的新模型，在自我中心运动生成和预测任务中具有世界领先的表现，尤其在从单一自我视角图像生成运动方面取得了突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法主要集中于第三人称运动合成以及3D场景上下文对运动预测的局限性，特别是在视野受限、遮挡频繁和动态摄像头的实际自我中心环境下的应用不足。

Method: 通过引入UniEgoMotion，一个统一的条件运动扩散模型，该模型使用了一种新颖的头部中心运动表述，适用于自我中心设备。

Conclusion: UniEgoMotion在自我中心运动重建方面达到了业界最高水平，并首次实现了从单一自我视角图像生成运动。

Abstract: Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is
crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction,
advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by
accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective.
However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with
structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world
egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and
dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks
that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without
relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional
motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored
for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports
egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person
visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene
semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer
plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a
large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth
3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in
egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a
single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of
our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling
and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI异常检测需要解决处理大规模数据、过拟合和类别不平衡等挑战。

Method: 使用深度强化学习（DRL）结合特征表示来应对标签稀缺、大规模数据和过拟合问题。

Result: 提出的方法在脑部MRI数据集上达到88.7%（像素级）和96.7%（图像级）的AUROC，优于SOTA方法，并在工业表面数据集上也表现出强劲的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: DRL的领域无关半监督方法在MRI异常检测中表现出显著的潜力，在医学和工业数据集上都取得了出色的性能。

Abstract: To develop a domain-agnostic, semi-supervised anomaly detection framework
that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address challenges such as
large-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance, focusing on brain MRI
volumes. This retrospective study used publicly available brain MRI datasets
collected between 2005 and 2021. The IXI dataset provided 581 T1-weighted and
578 T2-weighted MRI volumes (from healthy subjects) for training, while the
BraTS 2021 dataset provided 251 volumes for validation and 1000 for testing
(unhealthy subjects with Glioblastomas). Preprocessing included normalization,
skull-stripping, and co-registering to a uniform voxel size. Experiments were
conducted on both T1- and T2-weighted modalities. Additional experiments and
ablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The
proposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label
scarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on
several detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The
proposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7%
(image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA)
methods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive
performance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset,
indicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size
showed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without
evidence of overfitting or additional computational cost. The domain-agnostic
semi-supervised approach using DRL shows significant promise for MRI anomaly
detection, achieving strong performance on both medical and industrial
datasets. Its robustness, generalizability and efficiency highlight its
potential for real-world clinical applications.

TL;DR: DC3框架通过颜色补偿，提高浓缩图像的色彩多样性，以解决数据集浓缩中的性能和效率问题。实验结果表明其优越的性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据集浓缩需要在极度压缩的情况下平衡性能和保真度，但现有方法存在图像选择效率低和数据集蒸馏导致语义扭曲的问题，本文认为颜色的双重角色被忽视，改善浓缩图像的色彩丰富性对表示学习有益。

Method: 提出一种数据集浓缩框架DC3，通过颜色补偿提高浓缩图像的色彩多样性。利用潜在扩散模型进行颜色增强。

Result: 广泛实验表明DC3在多个基准上优于最新方法，证明了其优越性能和泛化能力。此外，FID结果表明，使用高质量数据集进行网络训练是可行的，不会出现模型崩溃问题。

Conclusion: DC3框架在数据集浓缩中考虑了颜色增强，解决了性能、保真度和颜色信息载体角色被忽视的问题。

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing
performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle
with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset
Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level
optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to
over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical
problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an
information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that
improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation
learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework
with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes
the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather
than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across
multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on
downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion
models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks
with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other
degradation issues. Code and generated data will be released soon.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D scene understanding have made significant strides
in enabling interaction with scenes using open-vocabulary queries, particularly
for VR/AR and robotic applications. Nevertheless, existing methods are hindered
by rigid offline pipelines and the inability to provide precise 3D object-level
understanding given open-ended queries. In this paper, we present
OpenGS-Fusion, an innovative open-vocabulary dense mapping framework that
improves semantic modeling and refines object-level understanding.
OpenGS-Fusion combines 3D Gaussian representation with a Truncated Signed
Distance Field to facilitate lossless fusion of semantic features on-the-fly.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal language-guided approach named
MLLM-Assisted Adaptive Thresholding, which refines the segmentation of 3D
objects by adaptively adjusting similarity thresholds, achieving an improvement
17\% in 3D mIoU compared to the fixed threshold strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in 3D object
understanding and scene reconstruction quality, as well as showcasing its

TL;DR: 提出了PSA框架，旨在通过个性化用户档案增强生成模型的安全性，以更好地贴合不同用户的安全偏好，并在实验中显示出其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的安全机制无法有效考虑用户的个体需求，忽视了年龄、心理健康和个人信仰所塑造的多样化安全界限。需要一种能根据用户特定控制生成模型安全行为的框架。

Method: PSA框架将个性化的用户档案整合到扩散过程中，通过跨注意力机制调整生成模型的行为，从而匹配个人的安全偏好。

Result: 实验表明，与现有方法相比，PSA在有害内容的抑制方面表现更好，生成内容的用户约束满意度更高。

Conclusion: PSA显著提高了生成内容的安全性，能够更好地满足用户的个人约束，通过Win Rate和Pass Rate得分确认了其优越性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation,
but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to
account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse
safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal
beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a
framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative
models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process,
adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while
preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures
user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a
cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing
methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with
user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code,
data, and models are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要高质量的可控二元图像分割，以实现高精度的个性化应用。

Method: 使用基于潜在扩散模型的图片条件遮罩生成，将语言和窗口控制策略结合，实现宏观和微观级别的用户控制。

Result: LawDIS实验结果在DIS5K基准上显著超越其他方法，提供更高的$F_β^ω$增益。

Conclusion: LawDIS框架在所有指标上显著优于11种最先进的方法，特别是在DIS-TE上，与第二好的模型MVANet相比，使用LS和WR策略时的$F_β^ω$提高了4.6%，仅使用LS策略时提高了3.6%。

Abstract: We present LawDIS, a language-window-based controllable dichotomous image
segmentation (DIS) framework that produces high-quality object masks. Our
framework recasts DIS as an image-conditioned mask generation task within a
latent diffusion model, enabling seamless integration of user controls. LawDIS
is enhanced with macro-to-micro control modes. Specifically, in macro mode, we
introduce a language-controlled segmentation strategy (LS) to generate an
initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a
window-controlled refinement strategy (WR) allows flexible refinement of
user-defined regions (i.e., size-adjustable windows) within the initial mask.
Coordinated by a mode switcher, these modes can operate independently or
jointly, making the framework well-suited for high-accuracy, personalised
applications. Extensive experiments on the DIS5K benchmark reveal that our
LawDIS significantly outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods across all metrics.
Notably, compared to the second-best model MVANet, we achieve $F_\beta^\omega$
gains of 4.6\% with both the LS and WR strategies and 3.6\% gains with only the
LS strategy on DIS-TE. Codes will be made available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂的视觉外观和有限的语义先验使场景文本识别面临挑战，因此提出一种新的训练范式以提高识别性能。

Method: 将目标标签编码到嵌入空间并应用损失感知屏蔽，通过逐步减少地面真值文本的影响来指导模型从依赖标签学习转向完全视觉识别。

Result: TEACH方法可以无缝地集成到现有的编码器-解码器框架中，并且在多个公开基准测试中表现出持续改进的准确性。

Conclusion: TEACH方法在多项公开基准测试中表现出色，尤其是在具有挑战性的条件下能显著提升模型精度，验证了其鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains a challenging task due to complex visual
appearances and limited semantic priors. We propose TEACH, a novel training
paradigm that injects ground-truth text into the model as auxiliary input and
progressively reduces its influence during training. By encoding target labels
into the embedding space and applying loss-aware masking, TEACH simulates a
curriculum learning process that guides the model from label-dependent learning
to fully visual recognition. Unlike language model-based approaches, TEACH
requires no external pretraining and introduces no inference overhead. It is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-decoder
frameworks. Extensive experiments across multiple public benchmarks show that
models trained with TEACH achieve consistently improved accuracy, especially
under challenging conditions, validating its robustness and general
applicability.

Motivation: 分析当前先进的方法，识别出计算上的两个主要瓶颈：transformer-based的迭代跟踪及相关特征计算成本高。

Method: 引入了粗细追踪策略和可学习的插值模块来逐步扩展跟踪轨迹集合，并优化了计算相关特征的成本。

Result: 通过优化方法，显著降低了计算成本，实现了速度上的巨大提升。

Conclusion: 相比现有方法，该算法实现了5到100倍的加速，同时保持了先进的跟踪精度。

Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for accelerating dense long-term 3D point
tracking in videos. Through analysis of existing state-of-the-art methods, we
identify two major computational bottlenecks. First, transformer-based
iterative tracking becomes expensive when handling a large number of
trajectories. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy that
begins tracking with a small subset of points and progressively expands the set
of tracked trajectories. The newly added trajectories are initialized using a
learnable interpolation module, which is trained end-to-end alongside the
tracking network. Second, we propose an optimization that significantly reduces
the cost of correlation feature computation, another key bottleneck in prior
methods. Together, these improvements lead to a 5-100x speedup over existing
approaches while maintaining state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.

Motivation: 本研究的动机是解决从稀疏多视图图像进行3D高斯喷绘的问题，而无需在训练或推理过程中提供真实姿态。

Method: 该方法采用共享特征提取骨干网，实现从未姿态输入到规范空间中的3D高斯原语和相机姿态的同时预测，结合渲染损失和重投影损失以增强几何约束。

Result: SPFSplat在缺乏姿态监督的条件下，在新视图合成方面达到最新的性能，即使在视角发生重大变化和图像重叠有限的情况下也表现优异，并在相对姿态估计方面超过了最近的几何先验训练方法。

Conclusion: SPFSplat是一个高效的3D高斯喷绘框架，在没有姿态监督的情况下，在新视图合成和相对姿态估计方面表现出众，适合实际应用。

Abstract: We introduce SPFSplat, an efficient framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from
sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during training or
inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone, enabling
simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a
canonical space from unposed inputs within a single feed-forward step.
Alongside the rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses, a
reprojection loss is integrated to enforce the learning of pixel-aligned
Gaussian primitives for enhanced geometric constraints. This pose-free training
paradigm and efficient one-step feed-forward design make SPFSplat well-suited
for practical applications. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose
supervision, SPFSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view
synthesis even under significant viewpoint changes and limited image overlap.
It also surpasses recent methods trained with geometry priors in relative pose
estimation. Code and trained models are available on our project page:

Conclusion: 我们的方法通过有效融合和多尺度几何特征传播实现了跨模态 3D 表征，并且采用了两阶段预测机制，提高了功能着陆和分类的性能。

Abstract: A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from
observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D
object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance
grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification).
Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to
inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In
addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas
depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and
operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances
significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address
these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D
representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the
dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first
develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and
multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential
affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple
two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and
classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on
natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in
autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend
on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all
voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object
representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy
grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it
integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering
more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task.
Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D
occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual,
and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information
from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder
for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a
grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and
a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting
model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding. The dataset is
available at https://github.com/RONINGOD/GroundingOcc.

Conclusion: 研究证明了使用深度学习模型分析卫星图像可以有效评估路面状况，结果显示准确率超过90%。

Abstract: Civil infrastructure systems covers large land areas and needs frequent
inspections to maintain their public service capabilities. The conventional
approaches of manual surveys or vehicle-based automated surveys to assess
infrastructure conditions are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. For
this reason, it is worthwhile to explore more cost-effective methods for
monitoring and maintaining these infrastructures. Fortunately, recent
advancements in satellite systems and image processing algorithms have opened
up new possibilities. Numerous satellite systems have been employed to monitor
infrastructure conditions and identify damages. Due to the improvement in
ground sample distance (GSD), the level of detail that can be captured has
significantly increased. Taking advantage of these technology advancement, this
research investigated to evaluate pavement conditions using deep learning
models for analyzing satellite images. We gathered over 3,000 satellite images
of pavement sections, together with pavement evaluation ratings from TxDOT's
PMIS database. The results of our study show an accuracy rate is exceeding 90%.
This research paves the way for a rapid and cost-effective approach to
evaluating the pavement network in the future.

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉Mamba架构在道路表面分类中的潜力，提出RoadMamba方法，通过结合局部和全局感知，达到了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于视觉技术提前获取道路表面状况为自动驾驶汽车的规划和控制系统提供了有效的信息，从而提高车辆的安全性和驾驶舒适度。现有Mamba架构在视觉处理任务中表现不错，但在道路表面分类任务中因为缺乏有效的局部纹理提取而表现不佳。

Method: 本文探索了视觉Mamba架构在道路表面分类任务中的潜力，并提出了一种有效结合局部与全局感知的方法，称为RoadMamba。具体来说，我们采用了双状态空间模型（DualSSM）来有效提取道路表面的全局语义和局部纹理，并通过双注意力融合（DAF）对双特征进行解码和融合。此外，我们提出了一种双辅助损失，显式约束双分支，防止网络仅依赖于深层大感受野的全局语义信息而忽略局部纹理。

Result: 在包含100万个样本的大规模道路表面分类数据集实验中，所提出的RoadMamba方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RoadMamba方法能够有效结合局部与全局感知，解决了现有Mamba架构在道路表面视觉分类中的不足，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Acquiring the road surface conditions in advance based on visual technologies
provides effective information for the planning and control system of
autonomous vehicles, thus improving the safety and driving comfort of the
vehicles. Recently, the Mamba architecture based on state-space models has
shown remarkable performance in visual processing tasks, benefiting from the
efficient global receptive field. However, existing Mamba architectures
struggle to achieve state-of-the-art visual road surface classification due to
their lack of effective extraction of the local texture of the road surface. In
this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of visual Mamba
architectures for road surface classification task and propose a method that
effectively combines local and global perception, called RoadMamba.
Specifically, we utilize the Dual State Space Model (DualSSM) to effectively
extract the global semantics and local texture of the road surface and decode
and fuse the dual features through the Dual Attention Fusion (DAF). In
addition, we propose a dual auxiliary loss to explicitly constrain dual
branches, preventing the network from relying only on global semantic
information from the deep large receptive field and ignoring the local texture.
The proposed RoadMamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance in experiments
on a large-scale road surface classification dataset containing 1 million
samples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StyDeco是一种解决风格迁移模型语义结构丢失问题的无监督框架，通过学习特定文本表示实现语义保留和风格转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的扩散模型在风格迁移中占据主导地位，但其基于文本驱动的机制受限于将文本描述视为单一指导，忽略了文本的非空间性与视觉风格的空间感之间的语义差距，导致语义结构和细节丢失。

Method: 提出了一种无监督框架StyDeco，首先使用先验指导数据蒸馏技术来提取风格知识，然后通过对比语义解耦任务目标，调整文本编码器，以形成明显的源和目标语义集群。

Result: 在三个经典基准测试上进行的大量实验证明，StyDeco在风格保真度和结构保存方面超过了几种现有方法。此外，框架还支持去风格化过程，展示其扩展性。

Conclusion: 提出的StyDeco框架有效地解决了当前风格迁移模型中语义结构丢失的问题，通过学习特定的文本表示来保持语义结构和细节。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for style transfer,
but their text-driven mechanism is hindered by a core limitation: it treats
textual descriptions as uniform, monolithic guidance. This limitation overlooks
the semantic gap between the non-spatial nature of textual descriptions and the
spatially-aware attributes of visual style, often leading to the loss of
semantic structure and fine-grained details during stylization. In this paper,
we propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by
learning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer
task. Our framework first employs Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD), a
strategy designed to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision. It
leverages a powerful frozen generative model to automatically synthesize
pseudo-paired data. Subsequently, we introduce Contrastive Semantic Decoupling
(CSD), a task-specific objective that adapts a text encoder using
domain-specific weights. CSD performs a two-class clustering in the semantic
space, encouraging source and target representations to form distinct clusters.
Extensive experiments on three classic benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework outperforms several existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity
and structural preservation, highlighting its effectiveness in style transfer
with semantic preservation. In addition, our framework supports a unique
de-stylization process, further demonstrating its extensibility. Our code is
vailable at https://github.com/QuanjianSong/StyDeco.

TL;DR: 通过利用广泛的视觉场景上下文信息和预训练房间识别技术，我们的FLoc算法在定位不确定性方面取得了显著改善，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑的平面图具有一致性并且对视觉变化具有鲁棒性，因此视觉平面图定位（FLoc）受到越来越多研究者的关注。然而，平面图的重复结构容易导致定位不明确。现有方法忽略了视觉图像提供的更丰富的上下文信息。

Method: 我们提出了一种无监督学习技术，通过聚类约束对自收集的未标注房间图像进行预训练，以获得房间识别能力，然后在FLoc算法中注入场景上下文信息。

Result: 在两个标准的视觉FLoc基准上进行对比研究，实验结果表明我们的方法在鲁棒性和准确性上都优于现有的方法。

Conclusion: 我们的方法通过利用视觉场景上下文信息，有效增强了FLoc算法的性能。实验结果显示，该方法在鲁棒性和准确性上均优于现有最新技术。

Abstract: Since a building's floorplan remains consistent over time and is inherently
robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc)
has received increasing attention from researchers. However, as a compact and
minimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many
repetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in
ambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D
structural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual
pre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual
images. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower
FLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty.
In particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering
constraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room
images. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of
the observed image and distinguish it from other room types. By injecting the
scene context information summarized by the discriminator into an FLoc
algorithm, the room style knowledge is effectively exploited to guide definite
visual FLoc. We conducted sufficient comparative studies on two standard visual
Floc benchmarks. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and achieves significant improvements in robustness
and accuracy.

Motivation: 现有重建方法存在网格与目标图像之间的错位，导致视觉细节丢失和渲染质量差。

Method: 提出MoGaFace框架，通过动量引导的一致性几何模块和隐纹理注意进行细节矫正与精细化处理。

Result: 实验结果表明，MoGaFace在面部头像重建和新视角合成质量上取得了显著提高，能够适应不准确的网格初始化和不受约束的真实世界环境。

Conclusion: MoGaFace框架显著提升了三维头像合成的质量，其表现优于现有方法，尤其是在视角转换和真实世界环境中。

Abstract: Existing 3D head avatar reconstruction methods adopt a two-stage process,
relying on tracked FLAME meshes derived from facial landmarks, followed by
Gaussian-based rendering. However, misalignment between the estimated mesh and
target images often leads to suboptimal rendering quality and loss of fine
visual details. In this paper, we present MoGaFace, a novel 3D head avatar
modeling framework that continuously refines facial geometry and texture
attributes throughout the Gaussian rendering process. To address the
misalignment between estimated FLAME meshes and target images, we introduce the
Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry module, which incorporates a
momentum-updated expression bank and an expression-aware correction mechanism
to ensure temporal and multi-view consistency. Additionally, we propose Latent
Texture Attention, which encodes compact multi-view features into head-aware
representations, enabling geometry-aware texture refinement via integration
into Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that MoGaFace achieves high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction and significantly improves novel-view synthesis
quality, even under inaccurate mesh initialization and unconstrained real-world
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN的梯度优化常导致权重结构混乱，损害特征清晰度和学习动态。

Method: ENN采用一种新的架构，通过共享的、学习的正交归一基对每层的权重进行重新参数化，实现去相关的、良好对齐的权重动态。

Result: ENN在图像分类和跨模态图像-文本检索任务中超过了现有最先进的方法，并且ENN-ℓ变体在训练速度和准确性上都有超越。

Conclusion: ENN显著改善了BP的代表性缺陷，并提升了性能，同时使得训练过程更加高效和可并行化。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) is driven by
gradient-based optimization, yet this process is often undermined by its
tendency to produce disordered weight structures, which harms feature clarity
and degrades learning dynamics. To address this fundamental representational
flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that
reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal
eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics
axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured
and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP,
ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image
classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations
generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval.
Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient,
backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\ell$. This variant
not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\times$
training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy
of end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm
that directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to
enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training
regime.

Motivation: 传统的可逆Spiking Neural Networks在反向传播中内存效率较高，但由于严格的顺序计算导致高延迟。

Method: 引入并行可逆SNN架构，在保持可逆性的同时解耦可逆块之间的顺序依赖性，实现块间并行。

Result: ParaRevSNN减少了训练时间达35.2%和推理时间至18.15%，同时在多个数据集上匹配或超越标准RevSNNs的准确性。

Conclusion: ParaRevSNN通过并行可逆块设计，实现了更快的训练和推理，同时保持了RevSNNs的内存节省优点，并在多个数据集上表现出与RevSNNs相当或更好的准确性。

Abstract: Reversible Spiking Neural Networks (RevSNNs) enable memory-efficient training
by reconstructing forward activations during backpropagation, but suffer from
high latency due to strictly sequential computation. To overcome this
limitation, we propose ParaRevSNN, a parallel reversible SNN architecture that
decouples sequential dependencies between reversible blocks while preserving
reversibility. This design enables inter-block parallelism, significantly
accelerating training and inference while retaining the memory-saving benefits
of reversibility. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128
Gesture demonstrate that ParaRevSNN matches or exceeds the accuracy of standard
RevSNNs, while reducing training time by up to 35.2\% and inference time to
18.15\%, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的增强缓存的TTA方法在低熵准则下选择样本用于原型构建，但在分布转变时可能不可靠，所以研究识别出缓存增强的性能与类内紧凑性之间的正相关，并据此提出了新方法。

Method: 提出了多缓存增强原型测试时间自适应（MCP）方法，包含熵缓存、对齐缓存和负缓存，另外发展了MCP++框架，加入了跨模态原型对齐和残差学习。

Result: 通过15个下游任务的对比和消融实验表明，所提出的方法和框架达到了最新的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 提出了一个多缓存增强的原型测试时间自适应方法MCP，通过引入不同的缓存机制改进了测试阶段模型的自适应性能。

Abstract: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using
unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test
distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy
criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class
compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution
shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class
distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between
cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this
observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time
Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing
prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for
integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class
distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using
high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating
cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype
residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve
state-of-the-art generalization performance.

Result: 在不同的多视图基准上进行的大量实验表明，所提出的框架在增强未知类别识别能力的同时，保持了对已知类别的强大识别性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的多视图开放集学习框架，通过处理歧义不确定性和视图偏差，提高了对未知类别的识别能力，同时保持了对已知类别的强大识别性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to
their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced
biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during
training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In
this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity
uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples,
we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with
calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed
by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns
for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based
contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific
ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn
generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class
recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型视觉语言模型取得了巨大成功，但其高计算成本严重限制了广泛应用。这主要归因于输入的视觉序列包含大量标记，因此需要一个方法在减少冗余标记的同时避免性能下降。

Method: 提出了一种名为自适应内容补偿方法（ACCM），通过生成图像字幕有效缓解视觉信息丢失。ACCM由轻量级字幕模型和选择器两部分组成，字幕模型生成与问题相关的描述，选择器从多个候选中识别适合的字幕。

Result: 通过在七个基准上进行广泛实验，ACCM以较低的FLOPs显著优于现有方法，例如以6.5%更少的FLOPs超过现有最佳方法20.6%。

Conclusion: ACCM能够有效减轻视觉信息丢失，并在较低计算成本条件下保持性能，从而提升大型视觉语言模型的实用性。

Abstract: Despite the great success of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), their high
computational cost severely limits their broad applications. The computational
cost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which
consists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods
have made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe
performance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual
information. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method
(ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image
caption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption
model and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related
descriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector
further identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates.
Leveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently
without any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments
across seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly
outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6%
with 6.5% fewer FLOPs).

Motivation: 当前的3D Gaussian Splatting抗噪重建方法在分离噪声上存在困难或需要针对具体场景进行参数微调，应用上不够便利。

Method: 提出一种创新框架OCSplats，通过结合混合噪音评估和基于观测的认知纠正等关键技术，提高认知差异区域噪声分类的准确性。此外，设计了基于动态锚点的标签噪音分类管道，以解决不同场景下噪声比例变化的问题。

Result: OCSplats在不同复杂程度的场景中，始终实现了领先的重建表现和准确的标签噪声分类。

Conclusion: OCSplats提供了一个无需参数调整即可应用于噪声比例差异巨大的场景的解决方案，并提升了噪声分类的准确性及重建表现。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the most promising 3D
reconstruction technologies. However, label noise in real-world scenarios-such
as moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces, and shadows-often leads to
reconstruction errors. Existing 3DGS-Bsed anti-noise reconstruction methods
either fail to separate noise effectively or require scene-specific fine-tuning
of hyperparameters, making them difficult to apply in practice. This paper
re-examines the problem of anti-noise reconstruction from the perspective of
epistemic uncertainty, proposing a novel framework, OCSplats. By combining key
technologies such as hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive
correction, the accuracy of noise classification in areas with cognitive
differences has been significantly improved. Moreover, to address the issue of
varying noise proportions in different scenarios, we have designed a label
noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points. This pipeline
enables OCSplats to be applied simultaneously to scenarios with vastly
different noise proportions without adjusting parameters. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OCSplats always achieve leading reconstruction performance and
precise label noise classification in scenes of different complexity levels.

TL;DR: The paper presents NS-Net, a novel framework that improves AI-generated image detection by removing semantic bias and achieving better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inability of existing detectors to generalize to unknown generative models, particularly when semantic content between real and fake images is closely aligned.

Method: NS-Net uses NULL-Space projection to remove semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive learning to identify differences between real and generated images, and employs Patch Selection to preserve fine-grained artifacts.

Result: NS-Net achieves a 7.4% improvement in detection accuracy on a benchmark with images from 40 diverse generative models.

Conclusion: NS-Net outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy and demonstrating strong generalization across various generative models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models,
has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing
concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing
detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to
generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content
between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the
use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical
limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual
features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net,
a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple
semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive
learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and
generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve
fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image
structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images
generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy,
thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and
diffusion-based image generation techniques.

Motivation: 现有的人脸解析方法依赖于昂贵且费时的密集像素级注释。为降低标注成本，引入了一种仅使用弱监督（如图像级标签和自然语言描述）的新任务设置，即弱监督人脸解析（WSFP）。

Method: 提出了一种名为DisFaceRep的表示去耦框架，通过显式和隐式机制分离共现的面部组件，其中包括共现组件去耦策略和基于文本引导的组件去耦损失。

Result: 在CelebAMask-HQ、LaPa和Helen等数据集上的大量实验表明，WSFP任务具有挑战性，而DisFaceRep方法显著提高了解析性能。

Conclusion: DisFaceRep在WSFP任务中展现了优异表现，显著优于现有的弱监督语义分割方法。

Abstract: Face parsing aims to segment facial images into key components such as eyes,
lips, and eyebrows. While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level
annotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To
reduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a
new task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only
weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions.
WSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual
similarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and
degraded parsing performance. To address this, we propose DisFaceRep, a
representation disentanglement framework designed to separate co-occurring
facial components through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. Specifically,
we introduce a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to explicitly
reduce dataset-level bias, and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to
guide component separation using language supervision implicitly. Extensive
experiments on CelebAMask-HQ, LaPa, and Helen demonstrate the difficulty of
WSFP and the effectiveness of DisFaceRep, which significantly outperforms
existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods. The code will be

*Yupeng Zhang,Ruize Han,Fangnan Zhou,Song Wang,Wei Feng,Liang Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该工作处理开放域开放词汇对象检测问题，构建了新基准OD-LVIS并提出了一种新检测方法，通过大量评估验证了方法和基准的有效性和优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决开放域开放词汇（ODOV）对象检测中的问题，特别是检测模型在实际环境中的适应性，包括域和类别变化。

Method: 提出了一种新的基线方法用于ODOV检测。该方法首先利用大型语言模型生成与领域无关的文本提示，用于类别嵌入。然后从给定的图像中学习领域嵌入，在测试过程中，该领域嵌入可以与类别嵌入整合，形成定制化的领域特定类别嵌入。

Result: 通过大量基准评估验证了ODOV检测任务的合理性，证实了我们基准数据集的实用性，以及我们提出方法的优越性。

Conclusion: ODOV检测的合理性得到了验证，提出的方法在新的OD-LVIS基准上表现优异，展示了其在处理实际世界对象检测方面的潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we handle a new problem of Open-Domain Open-Vocabulary (ODOV)
object detection, which considers the detection model's adaptability to the
real world including both domain and category shifts. For this problem, we
first construct a new benchmark OD-LVIS, which includes 46,949 images, covers
18 complex real-world domains and 1,203 categories, and provides a
comprehensive dataset for evaluating real-world object detection. Besides, we
develop a novel baseline method for ODOV detection.The proposed method first
leverages large language models to generate the domain-agnostic text prompts
for category embedding. It further learns the domain embedding from the given
image, which, during testing, can be integrated into the category embedding to
form the customized domain-specific category embedding for each test image. We
provide sufficient benchmark evaluations for the proposed ODOV detection task
and report the results, which verify the rationale of ODOV detection, the
usefulness of our benchmark, and the superiority of the proposed method.

*Zihan Li,Wei Sun,Jing Hu,Jianhua Yin,Jianlong Wu,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进图像聚类性能的自增强框架，在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中冻结编码器导致的任务无关表征与特定聚类任务需求不一致的问题，突破性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出了一种基于跨模态语义一致性的自增强框架用于图像聚类，通过两阶段优化：第一阶段通过挖掘图像-文本对之间的一致性训练聚类头，第二阶段通过自增强策略进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的方法在六个主流数据集上领先于现有深度聚类方法，ViT-B/32模型的准确度已达到甚至超越使用更大模型ViT-L/14的方法。

Conclusion: 通过跨模态语义一致性和自增强微调策略，改进了图像聚类的效果，使得预训练模型的编码器与特定聚类任务之间的差异缩小，提高了性能。实验表明方法比当前深度聚类方法表现更优。

Abstract: While large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP offer powerful
generic features for image clustering, existing methods typically freeze the
encoder. This creates a fundamental mismatch between the model's task-agnostic
representations and the demands of a specific clustering task, imposing a
ceiling on performance. To break this ceiling, we propose a self-enhanced
framework based on cross-modal semantic consistency for efficient image
clustering. Our framework first builds a strong foundation via Cross-Modal
Semantic Consistency and then specializes the encoder through Self-Enhancement.
In the first stage, we focus on Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency. By mining
consistency between generated image-text pairs at the instance, cluster
assignment, and cluster center levels, we train lightweight clustering heads to
align with the rich semantics of the pre-trained model. This alignment process
is bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers
and a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In
the second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The
well-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label
generator. These self-generated supervisory signals are then used to feed back
the efficient, joint optimization of the vision encoder and clustering heads,
unlocking their full potential. Extensive experiments on six mainstream
datasets show that our method outperforms existing deep clustering methods by
significant margins. Notably, our ViT-B/32 model already matches or even
surpasses the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods built upon the far larger
ViT-L/14.

### [47] [SpatioTemporal Difference Network for Video Depth Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01259)
*Zhengxue Wang,Yuan Wu,Xiang Li,Zhiqiang Yan,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STDNet is a new method for video depth super-resolution, improving accuracy by tackling long-tailed distributions in spatial and temporal areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the long-tailed distribution issues in video depth super-resolution, particularly in spatial non-smooth regions and temporal variation zones.

Method: The method involves a novel SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) with two branches: a spatial difference branch for RGB-D aggregation and depth calibration, and a temporal difference branch for motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show the effectiveness of STDNet, with the proposed method outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) enhances video depth super-resolution by addressing long-tailed distribution challenges, thus outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Depth super-resolution has achieved impressive performance, and the
incorporation of multi-frame information further enhances reconstruction
quality. Nevertheless, statistical analyses reveal that video depth
super-resolution remains affected by pronounced long-tailed distributions, with
the long-tailed effects primarily manifesting in spatial non-smooth regions and
temporal variation zones. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) comprising two core branches: a
spatial difference branch and a temporal difference branch. In the spatial
difference branch, we introduce a spatial difference mechanism to mitigate the
long-tailed issues in spatial non-smooth regions. This mechanism dynamically
aligns RGB features with learned spatial difference representations, enabling
intra-frame RGB-D aggregation for depth calibration. In the temporal difference
branch, we further design a temporal difference strategy that preferentially
propagates temporal variation information from adjacent RGB and depth frames to
the current depth frame, leveraging temporal difference representations to
achieve precise motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas. Extensive
experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our STDNet, outperforming existing approaches.

*Lexiao Zou,Gongwei Chen,Yanda Chen,Miao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ACS方法提高数据集蒸馏的效率和多样性，实验显示在Imagewoof和ImageNet-1k上取得明显性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高数据集蒸馏的性能，特别是在图像每类数和图像分辨率较高时面临性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出一种名为Adversary-guided Curriculum Sampling (ACS)的方法，通过对抗性损失来指导扩散采样过程，分割蒸馏数据集为多个课程，减少课程之间的信息重叠以增强数据多样性。

Result: ACS方法在Imagewoof上提升了4.1%，在ImageNet-1k上提升了2.1%，明显超过了现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: ACS通过对抗性损失指导扩散采样过程，有效地减轻了信息冗余，丰富了蒸馏数据集的多样性，并显著提高了性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to encapsulate the rich information contained in
dataset into a compact distilled dataset but it faces performance degradation
as the image-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger. Recent
advancements demonstrate that integrating diffusion generative models can
effectively facilitate the compression of large-scale datasets while
maintaining efficiency due to their superiority in matching data distribution
and summarizing representative patterns. However, images sampled from diffusion
models are always blamed for lack of diversity which may lead to information
redundancy when multiple independent sampled images are aggregated as a
distilled dataset. To address this issue, we propose Adversary-guided
Curriculum Sampling (ACS), which partitions the distilled dataset into multiple
curricula. For generating each curriculum, ACS guides diffusion sampling
process by an adversarial loss to challenge a discriminator trained on sampled
images, thus mitigating information overlap between curricula and fostering a
more diverse distilled dataset. Additionally, as the discriminator evolves with
the progression of curricula, ACS generates images from simpler to more
complex, ensuring efficient and systematic coverage of target data
informational spectrum. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
ACS, which achieves substantial improvements of 4.1\% on Imagewoof and 2.1\% on
ImageNet-1k over the state-of-the-art.

*Pedro Alonso,Tianrui Li,Chongshou Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 引入ModelNet40-E基准评估点云分类模型在噪声下的鲁棒性，发现Point Transformer v3校准能力最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏评估点云分类模型在合成LiDAR噪声下的鲁棒性和不确定性建模的基准。为此，本文引入ModelNet40-E，用于细粒度地评估不确定性建模。

Method: 本文引入了一个新的基准ModelNet40-E，用于评估点云分类模型在合成LiDAR噪声下的鲁棒性和校准能力。评估了三种流行的模型——PointNet、DGCNN和Point Transformer v3，使用分类准确性、校准指标和不确定性意识进行测试。

Result: Point Transformer v3在增加噪声情况下表现出更优的校准能力，其预测的不确定性与实际测量不确定性更为一致。

Conclusion: 在合成的LiDAR噪声条件下，所有模型的性能都会下降，但Point Transformer v3展示了更优的校准能力，其预测的不确定性与底层测量不确定性更为一致。

Abstract: We introduce ModelNet40-E, a new benchmark designed to assess the robustness
and calibration of point cloud classification models under synthetic LiDAR-like
noise. Unlike existing benchmarks, ModelNet40-E provides both noise-corrupted
point clouds and point-wise uncertainty annotations via Gaussian noise
parameters ({\sigma}, {\mu}), enabling fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
modeling. We evaluate three popular models-PointNet, DGCNN, and Point
Transformer v3-across multiple noise levels using classification accuracy,
calibration metrics, and uncertainty-awareness. While all models degrade under
increasing noise, Point Transformer v3 demonstrates superior calibration, with
predicted uncertainties more closely aligned with the underlying measurement
uncertainty.

### [50] [SGCap: Decoding Semantic Group for Zero-shot Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01270)
*Zeyu Pan,Ping Li,Wenxiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SGCap方法，通过语义组解码和监督模块提升零样本视频字幕生成性能，效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的零样本图像字幕生成方法在扩展到视频领域时忽略了时间动态性，且现有方法依赖于余弦相似度和单帧字幕监督，无法提供足够的视频层级监督。因此需要新的方法来处理视频字幕生成任务。

Method: 提出了一种语义组字幕生成（SGCap）方法，包含语义组解码（SGD）策略、关键句子选择（KSS）模块和概率采样监督（PSS）模块，专注于建模跨帧的时间关系和提升视频层级的监督效果。

Result: SGCap显著提升了零样本视频字幕生成的效果，在各项基准中表现优于先前的方法，并达到了与完全监督技术相竞争的性能。

Conclusion: SGCap在多个基准上的实验结果表明，其在零样本视频字幕生成任务中显著优于先前的最先进方法，且性能与完全监督的方法相当。

Abstract: Zero-shot video captioning aims to generate sentences for describing videos
without training the model on video-text pairs, which remains underexplored.
Existing zero-shot image captioning methods typically adopt a text-only
training paradigm, where a language decoder reconstructs single-sentence
embeddings obtained from CLIP. However, directly extending them to the video
domain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects
temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group
Captioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it
develops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame
information while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships.
Furthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine
similarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by
a single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level
supervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the
Key Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision
(PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups
that models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence
causal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video
captioning. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that SGCap
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot alternatives and
even achieves performance competitive with fully supervised ones. Code is
available at https://github.com/mlvccn/SGCap_Video.

*Zonglei Jing,Xiao Yang,Xiaoqian Li,Siyuan Liang,Aishan Liu,Mingchuan Zhang,Xianglong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptSafe通过优化提示词和自适应防御机制提高了文本到图像生成模型的安全性和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型易产生不安全内容，现有的调节措施存在高计算成本、图像质量下降以及适应性有限的问题。

Method: 提出PromptSafe框架，利用轻量文本监督的软嵌入和推理时的门控控制网络，通过改写危险提示词生成安全替代文本，并优化通用软提示词来调整生成过程，同时使用门控机制根据提示词毒性自适应调整防御强度。

Result: PromptSafe达到了SOTA级别的低不安全生成率，同时保持了高质量的良性图像生成，并展现了强大的泛化能力和跨模型结构间的迁移性。

Conclusion: PromptSafe提供了一种有效的解决方案，可以在不同的T2I模型和生成场景中安全、可扩展地部署。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW)
content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts
have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the
input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets
and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this
results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality,
but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements
of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a
gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised
soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of
training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into
semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an
efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal
soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the
diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we
introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength
based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with
prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving
benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and
T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%),
while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates
strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability
across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial
attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出一种无监督立体匹配方法，通过引入视差置信度和深度先导损失，提高了在无监督条件下的匹配准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督立体匹配因其不依赖昂贵的视差标注而备受关注，但传统无监督方法依赖于多视图一致性假设进行训练，容易受到立体匹配不确定性的影响。

Method: 提出了一种新的无监督学习框架，包括可插拔的视差置信度估计算法和两个深度先导的损失函数，利用视差置信度构建准稠密匹配以进行有效的深度排序学习，并通过双重视差平滑损失提升视差不连续处的匹配性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，在所有无监督立体匹配方法中，该方法在KITTI立体匹配基准上实现了最先进的匹配精度。

Conclusion: 通过新的无监督学习框架，有效解决了立体匹配中的不确定性问题，利用深度信息提高了无监督立体匹配的准确性。

Abstract: Unsupervised stereo matching has garnered significant attention for its
independence from costly disparity annotations. Typical unsupervised methods
rely on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, which
suffer considerably from stereo matching ambiguities, such as repetitive
patterns and texture-less regions. A feasible solution lies in transferring 3D
geometric knowledge from a relative depth map to the stereo matching networks.
However, existing knowledge transfer methods learn depth ranking information
from randomly built sparse correspondences, which makes inefficient utilization
of 3D geometric knowledge and introduces noise from mistaken disparity
estimates. This work proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework to
address these challenges, which comprises a plug-and-play disparity confidence
estimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions. Specifically,
the local coherence consistency between neighboring disparities and their
corresponding relative depths is first checked to obtain disparity confidence.
Afterwards, quasi-dense correspondences are built using only confident
disparity estimates to facilitate efficient depth ranking learning. Finally, a
dual disparity smoothness loss is proposed to boost stereo matching performance
at disparity discontinuities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art stereo matching accuracy on the KITTI Stereo
benchmarks among all unsupervised stereo matching methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言多实例学习方法由于语言模型的有限Token容量导致表达能力受限，而由语言模型生成的描述可能缺乏领域基础和精细的医学特异性，无法与视觉特征进行良好对齐。

Method: 设计一个新的视觉语言多实例学习框架，其中包含两个关键组成部分：一个利用病理学教科书和代理特化的多代理描述生成系统，以及一种使用描述列表而不是单一提示的文本编码策略。

Result: 所提出的框架在视觉语言模型-多实例学习管道中表现出相对于单提示词类别基线的性能提升，并与最先进的模型表现相当。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在肾脏和肺癌数据集上与当前最先进的模型表现相当，并且优于单提示词类别基线。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide
image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology
slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL
pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class
descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely
on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use
fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token
capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the
encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs
may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to
suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we
propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A
grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated
pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial
context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text
encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt,
capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment
with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows
improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results
comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer
datasets.

TL;DR: 提出一种不确定性指导的数据增强方法，提高立体匹配模型的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的立体匹配模型在训练中使用合成数据时，常常无法泛化到真实数据域，原因包括颜色、光照、对比度和纹理上的域差异。

Method: 本文提出了不确定性指导的数据增强（UgDA）方法，利用RGB空间中的图像统计数据来生成未见过域的样本，并通过批级统计建立高斯分布来模拟更多潜在域。不仅如此，还通过强制原始数据和增强数据在特征表示上的一致性，鼓励模型学习结构感知、快捷方式不变的特征表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法可以显著提高现有立体匹配网络的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 这种方法简单、与架构无关，可以集成到任何立体匹配网络中。

Abstract: State-of-the-art stereo matching (SM) models trained on synthetic data often
fail to generalize to real data domains due to domain differences, such as
color, illumination, contrast, and texture. To address this challenge, we
leverage data augmentation to expand the training domain, encouraging the model
to acquire robust cross-domain feature representations instead of
domain-dependent shortcuts. This paper proposes an uncertainty-guided data
augmentation (UgDA) method, which argues that the image statistics in RGB space
(mean and standard deviation) carry the domain characteristics. Thus, samples
in unseen domains can be generated by properly perturbing these statistics.
Furthermore, to simulate more potential domains, Gaussian distributions founded
on batch-level statistics are poposed to model the unceratinty of perturbation
direction and intensity. Additionally, we further enforce feature consistency
between original and augmented data for the same scene, encouraging the model
to learn structure aware, shortcuts-invariant feature representations. Our
approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and can be integrated into any SM
networks. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks have
demonstrated that our method can significantly improve the generalization
performance of existing SM networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D异常检测方法通常是针对于特定类别进行训练，缺乏从新出现的类别中学习的能力，而高精度工业产品检测需要能够处理多类别和新兴类别的能力。

Method: 提出一种名为持续3D异常检测（C3D-AD）的持续学习框架，能够为多类别点云学习广义表示并处理新的出现类别。特别是在特征提取模块中引入了具有随机特征层的Kernel Attention（KAL），以高效地从不同任务中的多样产品类型中提取广义局部特征。接着，提出了一种带有可学习的Advisor（KAA）机制的高效Kernel Attention来正确且持续地重建数据，学习新类别的信息同时在编码器和解码器中丢弃冗余旧信息。最后，设计了一种表示彩排损失函数的参数扰动重建（RPP）模块，以保证模型记住先前的类别信息并返回类别自适应表示。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的广泛实验证明了所提出方法的有效性，分别在Real3D-AD、Anomaly-ShapeNet和MulSen-AD上实现了66.4%、83.1%和63.4%的平均AUROC。

Conclusion: 所提出的C3D-AD框架有效地解决了多类别点云异常检测中持续学习的问题，展示了从新类别中学习并保持表示一致性的能力。

Abstract: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) has shown great potential in detecting anomalies or
defects of high-precision industrial products. However, existing methods are
typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of
learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning
framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only
learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle
new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module,
to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different
tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is
introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data
correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor
(KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories
while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder.
Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction
with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a
representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers
previous category information and returns category-adaptive
representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of
66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD,
respectively.

Conclusion: 我们的融合策略相较于单流和替代融合策略，提高了预测性能，但在解剖特异性和临床实用性方面仍存在不足。

Abstract: Distal myopathy represents a genetically heterogeneous group of skeletal
muscle disorders with broad clinical manifestations, posing diagnostic
challenges in radiology. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal
attention-aware fusion architecture that combines features extracted from two
distinct deep learning models, one capturing global contextual information and
the other focusing on local details, representing complementary aspects of the
input data. Uniquely, our approach integrates these features through an
attention gate mechanism, enhancing both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our method achieves a high classification accuracy on the
BUSI benchmark and a proprietary distal myopathy dataset, while also generating
clinically relevant saliency maps that support transparent decision-making in
medical diagnosis. We rigorously evaluated interpretability through (1)
functionally grounded metrics, coherence scoring against reference masks and
incremental deletion analysis, and (2) application-grounded validation with
seven expert radiologists. While our fusion strategy boosts predictive
performance relative to single-stream and alternative fusion strategies, both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal persistent gaps in anatomical
specificity and clinical usefulness of the interpretability. These findings
highlight the need for richer, context-aware interpretability methods and
human-in-the-loop feedback to meet clinicians' expectations in real-world
diagnostic settings.

Abstract: Recently, Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) has aroused
wide attention. To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing
methods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring
techniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view
structure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle
in handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we
instead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view
Semantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations. Motivated by
human behavior in observing targets of interest, the network orchestrates
visual cues from remote and close distances to conduct synergistic prediction.
In its every encoding stage, a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) is
utilized to supplement global and local semantics into close-view and
remote-view branch features, finally promoting the unified representation of
feature in every encoding stage. In addition, we develop a Collaboratively
Dilated Attention enhanced Decoder (CDAD) to mine the orientation property of
target and meanwhile integrate cross-view multiscale features. The proposed
network seamlessly enhances the exploitation of global and local semantics,
achieving significant improvements over others while maintaining satisfactory
speed.

*Konstantinos Moutselos,Ilias Maglogiannis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot image segmentation method using generative diffusion models efficiently detects skin erythema without relying on labeled data, showing improvements over traditional techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a scalable and flexible diagnostic support tool for erythema detection without relying on labeled dermatological datasets or annotated training masks.

Method: The method utilizes an edit-friendly inversion in diffusion models to synthesize reference images without erythema and aligns them with original images. It then applies color-space analysis to detect erythema, minimizing user intervention.

Result: The framework was able to successfully isolate facial erythema in diverse cases, outperforming baseline threshold-based methods in its initial qualitative experiments.

Conclusion: This framework showcases the potential of combining generative diffusion models with statistical color segmentation for advancing computer-aided dermatology applications.

Abstract: This study proposes a zero-shot image segmentation framework for detecting
erythema (redness of the skin) using edit-friendly inversion in diffusion
models. The method synthesizes reference images of the same patient that are
free from erythema via generative editing and then accurately aligns these
references with the original images. Color-space analysis is performed with
minimal user intervention to identify erythematous regions. This approach
significantly reduces the reliance on labeled dermatological datasets while
providing a scalable and flexible diagnostic support tool by avoiding the need
for any annotated training masks. In our initial qualitative experiments, the
pipeline successfully isolated facial erythema in diverse cases, demonstrating
performance improvements over baseline threshold-based techniques. These
results highlight the potential of combining generative diffusion models and
statistical color segmentation for computer-aided dermatology, enabling
efficient erythema detection without prior training data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StyleSentinel通过验证艺术品中的内在风格指纹来保护版权，并在单样本验证任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在保护网上发布的艺术作品时的有限防御能力问题，为艺术作品提供版权保护。

Method: 语义自我重建过程增强艺术品的风格表现力，建立风格一致的流形基础；自适应融合多层图像特征以编码艺术风格；将目标艺术家的风格建模为特征空间中的一个最小包围超球边界。

Result: StyleSentinel在单样本验证任务中表现优于现有技术，通过在线平台验证其有效性。

Conclusion: StyleSentinel能够有效保护艺术品的版权。

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images has led
to unauthorized usage of personal artwork, which poses a significant threat to
the intellectual property of artists. Existing approaches relying on embedding
additional information, such as perturbations, watermarks, and backdoors,
suffer from limited defensive capabilities and fail to protect artwork
published online. In this paper, we propose StyleSentinel, an approach for
copyright protection of artwork by verifying an inherent stylistic fingerprint
in the artist's artwork. Specifically, we employ a semantic self-reconstruction
process to enhance stylistic expressiveness within the artwork, which
establishes a dense and style-consistent manifold foundation for feature
learning. Subsequently, we adaptively fuse multi-layer image features to encode
abstract artistic style into a compact stylistic fingerprint. Finally, we model
the target artist's style as a minimal enclosing hypersphere boundary in the
feature space, transforming complex copyright verification into a robust
one-class learning task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with
the state-of-the-art, StyleSentinel achieves superior performance on the
one-sample verification task. We also demonstrate the effectiveness through
online platforms.

TL;DR: 研究提出ViLaCo框架，通过视觉-语言协同推理提升图像伪造定位的准确性，无需像素级注释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的弱监督图像伪造定位方法在定位性能上有限，缺乏外部语义指导。该研究旨在通过引入语义监督和视觉语言协同推理来提高定位精度。

Method: 提出一个视听协同推理框架ViLaCo，该框架通过视觉-语言模型提取语义知识，结合自适应视觉-语言推理网络进行语义对齐，并通过双预测头进行图像分类和像素级定位。

Result: ViLaCo超越了现有的弱监督图像伪造定位方法，在检测和定位精度上达到了最先进的表现。

Conclusion: ViLaCo框架显著提高了图像伪造定位的检测和定位准确性。

Abstract: Image forgery localization aims to precisely identify tampered regions within
images, but it commonly depends on costly pixel-level annotations. To alleviate
this annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL)
has emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization
performance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack
external semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper,
we propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that
introduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using
only image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic
knowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly
extracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive
vision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features
through mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations.
Subsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads,
where the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head
generates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak
supervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch
consistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating
authentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially
outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both detection and localization accuracy.

Method: 提出了一种新的转换器，结合了槽和特性，同时通过随机选择的槽-特性对来训练转换器，以学习转换动态。

Result: 实验表明，RandSF.Q方法在场景表示任务中显著超越了现有的视频对象中心学习方法，在对象发现方面提升了最多10个百分点。同时，新方法对下游任务如动态建模也提供了优势。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在视频无监督对象中心学习中显著优于现有方法，尤其是在对象发现方面提升了最多10个百分点，并为下游任务如动态建模提供了优势。

Abstract: Unsupervised video Object-Centric Learning (OCL) is promising as it enables
object-level scene representation and dynamics modeling as we humans do.
Mainstream video OCL methods adopt a recurrent architecture: An aggregator
aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some
queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame.
This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both
(\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative
source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition
dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these
issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction
(RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both
slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction;
(\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature
pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn
transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our
method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points
on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also
benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling. Our core source code and
training logs are available as the supplement.

Abstract: It is of crucial importance to assess damages promptly and accurately in

imagery with human knowledge understanding, there is an opportunity to generate
a diversified set of image-based damage data effectively. Our initial
experimental results suggest encouraging data generation quality, which
demonstrates an improvement in classifying scenes with different levels of
structural damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructures.

Abstract: False positives in pedestrian detection remain a challenge that has yet to be
effectively resolved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage
Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives
within a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main
innovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature
re-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during
both the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the
Training mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating
pedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby
constructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.
During the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the
Classifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into
the proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through
pedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm
vertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region
proposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,
filtering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a
result, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress
pedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on
multiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,
supported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively
eliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments
conducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in
enhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small
pedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的轻量级混合主干网络部分缓解了计算饱和问题，但卷积神经网络与注意力机制之间的计算效率失衡问题愈发明显。特别是线性注意力机制及其变体在轻量化设计方面取得一定进展，但仍无法满足混合模型对于长序列建模的需求。

Conclusion: LOLViT在推理速度和模型准确性方面均优于同级别的CNN模型。特别是LOLViT-X的推理速度为MobileViT-X的5倍。

Abstract: Currently, lightweight hybrid backbone networks have partially alleviated the
issue of computational saturation, but the imbalance in computational
efficiencys between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention
mechanisms is becoming increasingly apparent. Specifically, although linear
attention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight
design, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence
modeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention
computations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the
number of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the
process of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and
computational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature
map sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of
key sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention
computation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to
simulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms.
Finally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines
it with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT.
Through visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO
2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is
demonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both
inference speed and model accuracy. Notably, the inference speed of LOLViT-X is
5x that of MobileViT-X.

Abstract: Digital terrain maps (DTMs) are an important part of planetary exploration,
enabling operations such as terrain relative navigation during entry, descent,
and landing for spacecraft and aiding in navigation on the ground. As robotic
exploration missions become more ambitious, the need for high quality DTMs will
only increase. However, producing DTMs via multi-view stereo pipelines for
satellite imagery, the current state-of-the-art, can be cumbersome and require
significant manual image preprocessing to produce satisfactory results. In this
work, we seek to address these shortcomings by adapting neural volume rendering
techniques to learn textured digital terrain maps directly from satellite
imagery. Our method, neural terrain maps (NTM), only requires the locus for
each image pixel and does not rely on depth or any other structural priors. We
demonstrate our method on both synthetic and real satellite data from Earth and
Mars encompassing scenes on the order of $100 \textrm{km}^2$. We evaluate the
accuracy of our output terrain maps by comparing with existing high-quality
DTMs produced using traditional multi-view stereo pipelines. Our method shows
promising results, with the precision of terrain prediction almost equal to the
resolution of the satellite images even in the presence of imperfect camera
intrinsics and extrinsics.

Abstract: Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) and vehicle make and model
recognition underpin intelligent transportation systems, supporting law
enforcement, toll collection, and post-incident investigation. Applying these
methods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static
vehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed
installations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints,
occlusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on
specialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these
conditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable
direct recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery.
This study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models
recognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and
non-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline
filters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several
prompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a
revised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection
module, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class
dataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected
on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of
91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public
UFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The
self-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make
and model recognition. These findings demonstrate that VLMs provide a
cost-effective solution for scalable, in-motion traffic video analysis.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) plays a crucial role in various vision
tasks such as person retrieval and identification. Most existing
attribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that
all attribute classes are consistently available during both training and
inference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world
scenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in
benchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them
less discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these
challenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval
(OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues,
regardless of whether those attributes were seen during training. To support
this task, we introduce a novel framework designed to learn generalizable body
part representations that cover a broad range of attribute categories.
Furthermore, we reconstruct four widely used datasets for open-attribute
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the
necessity of the OAPR task and the effectiveness of our framework. The source
code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.

Result: 增强后的RAW对象检测框架能够更好地恢复和利用RAW数据中的对象细节，提高检测性能。

Conclusion: 提出了一种空间频率感知的RAW图像对象检测增强框架（SFAE），能够在空间和频率域中增强RAW数据，以改善对象检测性能。

Abstract: Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data
(unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide
dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object
details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed
in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these
suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address
this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as
object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In
this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection
Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency
representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the
``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm
of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method
inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial
maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion
attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between
these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs
adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma
parameters for the two domains.

Abstract: Advances in generative models have led to AI-generated images visually
indistinguishable from authentic ones. Despite numerous studies on detecting
AI-generated images with classifiers, a gap persists between such methods and
human cognitive forensic analysis. We present ForenX, a novel method that not
only identifies the authenticity of images but also provides explanations that
resonate with human thoughts. ForenX employs the powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) to analyze and interpret forensic cues. Furthermore, we
overcome the limitations of standard MLLMs in detecting forgeries by
incorporating a specialized forensic prompt that directs the MLLMs attention to
forgery-indicative attributes. This approach not only enhance the
generalization of forgery detection but also empowers the MLLMs to provide
explanations that are accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. Additionally, we
introduce ForgReason, a dataset dedicated to descriptions of forgery evidences
in AI-generated images. Curated through collaboration between an LLM-based
agent and a team of human annotators, this process provides refined data that
further enhances our model's performance. We demonstrate that even limited
manual annotations significantly improve explanation quality. We evaluate the
effectiveness of ForenX on two major benchmarks. The model's explainability is
verified by comprehensive subjective evaluations.

Result: 在SUN RGB-D数据集上的单目3D检测任务中，3DRot将3D交并比从43.21提升到44.51，旋转误差从22.91°降低到20.93°，并将mAP0.5从35.70提升到38.11。

Conclusion: 3DRot是一个有效的几何一致的图像增强方案，可以提高单目3D检测性能，并且容易应用于其他3D任务。

Abstract: RGB-based 3D tasks, e.g., 3D detection, depth estimation, 3D keypoint
estimation, still suffer from scarce, expensive annotations and a thin
augmentation toolbox, since most image transforms, including resize and
rotation, disrupt geometric consistency. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a
plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's
optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics,
object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving
geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene
depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On
SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation
error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from
35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with
SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test
dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7
to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is
readily transferable to other 3D tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多域表示学习在在线手写验证中的潜力，以超越传统方法的时域单一表现。

Method: SPECTRUM通过多尺度互作用器和自门控融合模块实现微观到宏观的频谱-时间整合，并使用多域基于距离的验证器增强判别能力。

Result: 实验表明，SPECTRUM在OHV中的表现优于现有方法，并展示了多域手写生物特征的整合能够提升判别能力。

Conclusion: SPECTRUM模型展现了在多域学习中的优势，特别是在在线手写验证方面，能够有效提高真伪判别能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model
that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for
online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core
components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and
frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale
aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global
temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components
work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration.
(3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and
frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged
handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive
experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV
methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain
learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten
biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting
representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate
the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future
research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

TL;DR: 引入粒度的概念，提出一种新模型，通过多粒度非局部自相似先验实现高光谱图像恢复，具备良好的适用性和恢复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于非局部先验表示的高光谱图像恢复方法不能适应不同的缺失场景，因此提出了一种新的模型。

Method: 引入粒度的概念并构建了一个受到多粒度非局部自相似先验约束的高光谱图像恢复模型，通过对非局部自相似张量组交替执行粗粒度和细粒度分解来实现。粗粒度分解基于Tucker张量分解，细粒度分解则采用FCTN分解。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型在各种像素和条纹缺失场景中表现出良好的适用性和恢复效果。

Conclusion: 提出的模型能够在不同类型的缺失情况下实现共同的全球、局部和非局部先验表示。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery, as an upstream image processing task,
  holds significant importance for downstream tasks such as classification,
  segmentation, and detection. In recent years, HSI recovery methods based on
  non-local prior representations have demonstrated outstanding performance.
However,
  these methods employ a fixed-format factor to represent the non-local
self-similarity
  tensor groups, making them unable to adapt to diverse missing scenarios. To
address
  this issue, we introduce the concept of granularity in tensor decomposition
for the first
  time and propose an HSI recovery model constrained by multi-granularity
non-local
  self-similarity priors. Specifically, the proposed model alternately performs
  coarse-grained decomposition and fine-grained decomposition on the non-local
  self-similarity tensor groups. Among them, the coarse-grained decomposition
builds
  upon Tucker tensor decomposition, which extracts global structural
information of the
  image by performing singular value shrinkage on the mode-unfolded matrices.
The
  fine-grained decomposition employs the FCTN decomposition, capturing local
detail
  information through modeling pairwise correlations among factor tensors. This
  architectural approach achieves a unified representation of global, local,
and non-local
  priors for HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has strong
  applicability and exhibits outstanding recovery effects in various types of
missing
  scenes such as pixels and stripes.

Motivation: 在临床环境缺乏手动注释的情况下，评估分割质量成为挑战，并且缺乏可靠性指标的模型面临采纳障碍。

Method: 通过贝叶斯改编的SwinUNet和特征金字塔网络，使用蒙特卡罗丢弃率、集合和测试时间增强来估算不确定性。

Result: 在HAM10000数据集上获得了93.25的R2分数和96.58的Pearson相关性，显著优于之前的方法。在3D肝脏分割中，测试时间增强与熵达到了85.03的R2分数和65.02的Pearson相关性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种无需测试时需要真实标签的新框架，利用不确定性地图等预测分割质量，表现出色。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical step in computational biomedical image
analysis, typically evaluated using metrics like the Dice coefficient during
training and validation. However, in clinical settings without manual
annotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models
lacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we
propose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring
ground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two
complementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty
maps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and
predicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark
segmentation models-SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50-using
Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify
uncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates: confidence map, entropy,
mutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence on 2D
skin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation
with segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25
and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming
previous segmentation quality assessment methods. For 3D liver segmentation,
Test Time Augmentation with entropy achieves an R2 score of 85.03 and a Pearson
correlation of 65.02, demonstrating cross-modality robustness. Additionally, we
propose an aggregation strategy that combines multiple uncertainty estimates
into a single score per image, offering a more robust and comprehensive
assessment of segmentation quality. Finally, we use Grad-CAM and UMAP-based
embedding analysis to interpret the model's behavior and reliability,
highlighting the impact of uncertainty integration.

TL;DR: Can3Tok是首个能有效处理3D场景级数据的VAE，解决了生成中尺度不一致性的问题，在DL3DV-10K数据集上展现良好的泛化能力，并支持图像和文本生成到3D场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管3D生成技术取得了显著进展，但仍主要集中在对象级别。探索3D场景级别的前馈生成较少，原因在于缺乏能够扩展3D场景级数据潜在表示学习的模型。

Method: 本研究设计了Can3Tok，一个3D场景级别的变分自编码器（VAE），以及处理3D场景数据尺度不一致性问题的通用管道。

Result: 证实了Can3Tok能够成功在场景级别的3D数据集DL3DV-10K上进行新颖的3D场景生成，而现有方法在训练中无法处理数百个场景输入，并且在推理中缺乏泛化能力。同时演示了图像到3DGS和文本到3DGS生成的应用。

Conclusion: Can3Tok在DL3DV-10K数据集上展现了良好的泛化能力，能够成功进行新颖的3D场景生成，而对比方法在训练期间无法收敛，在推理期间也没有泛化能力。

Abstract: 3D generation has made significant progress, however, it still largely
remains at the object-level. Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been
rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent
representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative
models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space,
scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes,
making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely
challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level
variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian
primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures
both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we
propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale
inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D
dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to
novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred
scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during
inference. Finally, we demonstrate image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation as
our applications to demonstrate its ability to facilitate downstream generation
tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient brain tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge
in neuroimaging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor subregions and the
high computational cost of volumetric inference. In this paper, we propose
EfficientGFormer, a novel architecture that integrates pretrained foundation
models with graph-based reasoning and lightweight efficiency mechanisms for
robust 3D brain tumor segmentation. Our framework leverages nnFormer as a
modality-aware encoder, transforming multi-modal MRI volumes into patch-level
embeddings. These features are structured into a dual-edge graph that captures
both spatial adjacency and semantic similarity. A pruned, edge-type-aware Graph
Attention Network (GAT) enables efficient relational reasoning across tumor
subregions, while a distillation module transfers knowledge from a
full-capacity teacher to a compact student model for real-time deployment.
Experiments on the MSD Task01 and BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that
EfficientGFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced
memory and inference time, outperforming recent transformer-based and
graph-based baselines. This work offers a clinically viable solution for fast

interpretability, and generalization.

Method: 提出了一种名为MiraGe的方法，旨在通过生成器不变特征来检测AI生成的图像，并运用了多模态提示学习和CLIP中的文本嵌入以实现出色的判别式表示学习。

Result: MiraGe通过将同一类别内的特征紧密对齐，同时最大化类别间分离度，提高特征判别力，进而改善通用性。

Conclusion: MiraGe在多项基准测试中展示了最先进的性能，能够在针对未见过的生成器如Sora时保持稳健性。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have highlighted the need for robust
detectors capable of distinguishing real images from AI-generated images. While
existing methods perform well on known generators, their performance often
declines when tested with newly emerging or unseen generative models due to
overlapping feature embeddings that hinder accurate cross-generator
classification. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Discriminative
Representation Learning for Generalizable AI-generated Image Detection
(MiraGe), a method designed to learn generator-invariant features. Motivated by
theoretical insights on intra-class variation minimization and inter-class
separation, MiraGe tightly aligns features within the same class while
maximizing separation between classes, enhancing feature discriminability.
Moreover, we apply multimodal prompt learning to further refine these
principles into CLIP, leveraging text embeddings as semantic anchors for
effective discriminative representation learning, thereby improving
generalizability. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show
that MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even
against unseen generators like Sora.

Conclusion: ReasonAct方法通过分阶段训练，提高了小模型在视频理解任务中的表现。

Abstract: While recent multimodal models have shown progress in vision-language tasks,
small-scale variants still struggle with the fine-grained temporal reasoning
required for video understanding. We introduce ReasonAct, a method that
enhances video reasoning in smaller models through a three-stage training
process: first building a foundation with text-only reasoning, then fine-tuning
on video, and finally refining with temporal-aware reinforcement learning. We
build upon Temporal Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) by
incorporating temporal consistency modeling into policy optimization. We also
propose a biomechanically-motivated sub-action decomposition mechanism that
provides graduated rewards for constituent action phases. Through experiments
on HMDB51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400, our 3B-parameter model achieves 67.2%,
94.1%, and 78.9% accuracy respectively, demonstrating improvements of 17.9,

progressive training methodology enables smaller models to achieve competitive

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in
recent years, enabling a diverse array of applications in everyday life.
However, the substantial computational and storage demands of VLMs pose
significant challenges for their efficient deployment on mobile devices, which
represent the most ubiquitous and accessible computing platforms today. In this
work, we introduce MagicVL-2B, a novel VLM meticulously optimized for flagship
smartphones. MagicVL-2B leverages a lightweight visual encoder with fewer than
100M parameters and features a redesigned dynamic resolution scheme that
adaptively generates image tokens without excessive modification of image
dimensions. To further enhance the performance of this compact encoder within
VLMs, we propose a multimodal curriculum learning strategy that incrementally
increases task difficulty and data information density throughout training.
This approach substantially improves the model's performance across a variety
of sub-tasks. Extensive evaluations on standard VLM benchmarks demonstrate that
MagicVL-2B matches the accuracy of current state-of-the-art models while
reducing on-device power consumption by 41.1%. These results establish
MagicVL-2B as a practical and robust solution for real-world mobile
vision-language applications, enabling advanced multimodal intelligence to run
directly on smartphones.

TL;DR: E-VRAG通过优化帧检索和使用轻量级模型，大幅降低计算成本并提升视频理解的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频-语言模型在视频理解中的应用受限于上下文窗口限制和处理长视频的高计算成本。为了降低计算负担，检索增强型生成方法（RAG）被提出，但在处理复杂的视频内容时难以平衡检索效率和准确性。

Method: E-VRAG是一种新颖的视频RAG框架，通过层次化查询分解的方法预筛选视频帧，使用轻量级的视觉语言模型评分帧，并利用全局统计分布进行帧检索，从而减低计算成本。最终采用多视图问答机制来增强信息提取能力。

Result: E-VRAG在四个公共基准上显示出比基线方法高的准确性，并减少约70%的计算成本，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: E-VRAG在视频理解任务中提高了效率和准确性，证明其在视频RAG应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled substantial progress in video
understanding by leveraging cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, their
effectiveness is limited by the restricted context window and the high
computational cost required to process long videos with thousands of frames.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by selecting only
the most relevant frames as input, thereby reducing the computational burden.
Nevertheless, existing video RAG methods struggle to balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy, particularly when handling diverse and complex video
content. To address these limitations, we propose E-VRAG, a novel and efficient
video RAG framework for video understanding. We first apply a frame
pre-filtering method based on hierarchical query decomposition to eliminate
irrelevant frames, reducing computational costs at the data level. We then
employ a lightweight VLM for frame scoring, further reducing computational
costs at the model level. Additionally, we propose a frame retrieval strategy
that leverages the global statistical distribution of inter-frame scores to
mitigate the potential performance degradation from using a lightweight VLM.
Finally, we introduce a multi-view question answering scheme for the retrieved
frames, enhancing the VLM's capability to extract and comprehend information
from long video contexts. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that
E-VRAG achieves about 70% reduction in computational cost and higher accuracy
compared to baseline methods, all without additional training. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of E-VRAG in improving both efficiency and
accuracy for video RAG tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法采用固定压缩率，在复杂变化场景下难以适应，导致视觉信息丢失及性能下降。

Method: 提出了一种动态裁剪框架GlimpsePrune，通过数据驱动的'窥视'在答案生成前的单次前馈过程中裁剪不相关视觉标记。

Result: GlimpsePrune可以裁剪92.6%的视觉标记，同时完全保持在自由形式VQA任务上的基线性能，并降低计算成本。通过更有效的微调，增强版GlimpsePrune+在保持高裁剪率的同时实现了110%的基线性能。

Conclusion: GlimpsePrune打造了一个更强大、更高效的视觉语言模型构建方法。

Abstract: Visual token compression is critical for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
to efficiently process high-resolution inputs. Existing methods that typically
adopt fixed compression ratios cannot adapt to scenes of varying complexity,
often causing imprecise pruning that discards informative visual tokens and
results in degraded model performance. To address this issue, we introduce a
dynamic pruning framework, GlimpsePrune, inspired by human cognition. It takes
a data-driven ''glimpse'' and prunes irrelevant visual tokens in a single
forward pass before answer generation. This approach prunes 92.6% of visual
tokens while on average fully retaining the baseline performance on free-form
VQA tasks. The reduced computational cost also enables more effective
fine-tuning: an enhanced GlimpsePrune+ achieves 110% of the baseline
performance while maintaining a similarly high pruning rate. Our work paves a
new way for building more powerful and efficient LVLMs.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been exploited in various
Computer Vision tasks (e.g., few-shot recognition) via model adaptation, such
as prompt tuning and adapters. However, existing adaptation methods are
designed by human experts, requiring significant time cost and experience.
Inspired by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) based code
generation, we propose an Evolutionary Vision-Language Model Adaptation
(EvoVLMA) method to automatically search training-free efficient adaptation
algorithms for VLMs. We recognize feature selection and logits computation as
the key functions in training-free VLM adaptation, and propose a two-stage
LLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm for optimizing these parts in a sequential
manner, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the expansive search
space through a divide-and-conquer strategy. Besides, to enhance the stability
and efficiency of searching process, we propose low-precision code conversion,
web based code execution and process monitoring, leading to a highly effective
automatic algorithm design system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
algorithms found by EvoVLMA can obtain promising results compared to previous
manually-designed ones. More specifically, in the 8-shot image classification
setting, the classical APE algorithm can be improved by 1.91 points in
recognition accuracy. This research opens new possibilities for automating the
optimization of adaptation algorithms of pre-trained multimodal models. Code is

Motivation: 传统LiDAR传感器在扫描时由于忽视场景的强时间连续性而存在大量冗余和过度能耗，限制了其在资源受限平台上的实用性。为解决这一问题，本研究提出了一种能够预测和适应性扫描的方法。

Method: 提出了一种预测的历史感知自适应扫描框架，通过轻量级预测网络和可微分的Mask Generator网络生成二进制掩码，以区分下一帧的关键ROI。目前的实验表明，该方法能有效减少LiDAR能耗。

Result: 与传统LiDAR-摄像头融合方法相比，在节能的同时保持甚至超过了3D物体检测的性能，特别是在nuScenes和Lyft基准测试中实验显示能耗减少超过65%。

Conclusion: 通过将稀疏LiDAR扫描集中在预测的关键感兴趣区域（ROI），显著减少不必要的数据采集，从而在保持或提升3D物体检测性能的同时减少了65%以上的LiDAR能耗。

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion using LiDAR and RGB cameras significantly enhances 3D
object detection task. However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense,
stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes.
This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption,
limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning
framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past
observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that
distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query
embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network,
which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying
critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces
unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within
these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft
benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy
consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D
object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion
methods with dense LiDAR scanning.

computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical
approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random
data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while
retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core
characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when
high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability
but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above
insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for
ViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and
original image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget
specific details while retaining the general cl category outlines. Experimental
results demonstrate that LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
effectively balancing privacy compliance with model efficacy.

TL;DR: TopoImages方法通过编码局部拓扑结构来提高图像分类的准确性，特别是在医学图像领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于外观信息的图像处理方法在处理图像中的拓扑结构时常表现出不足，需要一种新方法来有效识别和利用图像的拓扑结构。

Method: 利用持久同调对图像补丁中的几何和拓扑特征进行编码，生成新的图像表示形式TopoImage，并通过多种过滤函数生成多视图TopoImages，与输入图像结合进行深度学习分类。

Result: TopoImages方法在三个公共医学图像分类数据集上明显提高了分类准确性，比现有最先进的方法表现更优。

Conclusion: TopoImages方法通过引入多视图拓扑图像的概念，改进了医用图像分类的准确性。

Abstract: Topological structures in image data, such as connected components and loops,
play a crucial role in understanding image content (e.g., biomedical objects).
% Despite remarkable successes of numerous image processing methods that rely
on appearance information, these methods often lack sensitivity to topological
structures when used in general deep learning (DL) frameworks. % In this paper,
we introduce a new general approach, called TopoImages (for Topology Images),
which computes a new representation of input images by encoding local topology
of patches. % In TopoImages, we leverage persistent homology (PH) to encode
geometric and topological features inherent in image patches. % Our main
objective is to capture topological information in local patches of an input
image into a vectorized form. % Specifically, we first compute persistence
diagrams (PDs) of the patches, % and then vectorize and arrange these PDs into
long vectors for pixels of the patches. % The resulting multi-channel
image-form representation is called a TopoImage. % TopoImages offers a new
perspective for data analysis. % To garner diverse and significant topological
features in image data and ensure a more comprehensive and enriched
representation, we further generate multiple TopoImages of the input image
using various filtration functions, which we call multi-view TopoImages. % The
multi-view TopoImages are fused with the input image for DL-based
classification, with considerable improvement. % Our TopoImages approach is
highly versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into common DL frameworks.
Experiments on three public medical image classification datasets demonstrate
noticeably improved accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出SECA框架，通过语义指导知识转移，解决稳定性和可塑性之间的矛盾，并在多个基准上验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在持续学习中的表现吸引了广泛关注，但其在解决稳定性与可塑性之间的矛盾方面的潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Method: 提出SECA框架，通过语义引导的自适应知识转移模块（SG-AKT）和语义增强的视觉原型细化模块（SE-VPR）来实现结构化语义指导的知识转移。

Result: 在多个基准上进行广泛实验，验证了所提出方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SECA通过利用文本先验结构的抗遗忘性和结构化特性，实现语义感知的知识转移，有效解决稳定性与可塑性之间的矛盾。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to equip models with the ability to learn from a
stream of tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. With the progress of
vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP),
their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong
generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in
CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored.
During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without
considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks
that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while
text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited
plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help
bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To
address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation
(SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured
nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the
backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier.
Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is
proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge
via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive
manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype
Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using
inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our
approach.

Motivation: 传统的领域泛化假设在训练期间目标领域是不可访问的，但视觉基础模型的出现使这一假设不再适用。论文提出了一个更适合当前研究和应用要求的新定义的领域迁移任务。

Method: 论文提出了集合枢轴学习（SPL）和动态提示微调方法，结合动态类感知提示器和提示引导特征聚焦器，以提升视觉基础模型在目标场景中的性能。

Conclusion: 集合枢轴学习（SPL）重新定义了基于视觉基础模型的领域泛化，通过动态适应与VFM为中心的调整实现对任务特定表示的优化，同时保持跨域鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the concept of Set Pivot
Learning, a paradigm shift that redefines domain generalization (DG) based on
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Traditional DG assumes that the target domain
is inaccessible during training, but the emergence of VFMs, trained on vast and
diverse data, renders this assumption unclear and obsolete. Traditional DG
assumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the
emergence of VFMs, which are trained on vast and diverse datasets, renders this
assumption unclear and obsolete. To address this challenge, we propose Set
Pivot Learning (SPL), a new definition of domain migration task based on VFMs,
which is more suitable for current research and application requirements.
Unlike conventional DG methods, SPL prioritizes adaptive refinement over rigid
domain transfer, ensuring continuous alignment with evolving real-world
conditions. Specifically, SPL features two key attributes: (i) Dynamic
adaptation, transitioning from static domain alignment to flexible, task-driven
feature optimization, enabling models to evolve with downstream scenarios; (ii)
VFM-centric tuning, leveraging pretrained knowledge as a pivot to hone
task-specific representations while preserving cross-domain robustness.
Building on SPL, we propose a Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method, which combines
a Dynamic Class-aware Prompter with a Prompt-guided Feature Focuser, to elevate
VFM performance in targeted scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets show the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its superiority
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in generalized segmentation.

Method: 提出一种名为STCN的双阶段方法，第一阶段使用时空连续网络生成更平滑的人体动作序列，并引入锚集以防止模式崩溃；第二阶段通过锚集获取观察动作序列的高斯混合分布，并从每个锚点采样多个序列以缓解人体动作中的类内差异。

Result: 实验结果表明，STCN在两个广泛使用的数据集（Human3.6M和HumanEva-I）上表现出色。

Conclusion: STCN模型在多样性和准确性上表现出竞争力，能够生成更平滑的人体动作序列并防止模式崩溃。

Abstract: Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) has received increasing attention
due to its wide applications. Despite the rapid progress in generative fields,
existing methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics
and predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the
flexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse.
To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for
stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two
stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal
continuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition,
the anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to
prevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns. In
the second stage, STCN endeavors to acquire the Gaussian mixture distribution
(GMM) of observed motion sequences with the aid of the anchor set. It also
focuses on the probability associated with each anchor, and employs the
strategy of sampling multiple sequences from each anchor to alleviate
intra-class differences in human motions. Experimental results on two
widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model
obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate
knowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently,
replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by
rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing
historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,
exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without
storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer
from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge
representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from
sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling
Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the
training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the
condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the
privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more
representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align
the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay
samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy
effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused
by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the
proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving
data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on
sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other
replay-based methods, respectively.

TL;DR: SNARM introduces a novel method for industrial anomaly detection using self-referential learning, outperforming existing methods across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve anomaly discrimination by utilizing self-referential learning instead of relying solely on pre-trained features.

Method: SNARM uses self-referential learning within test images, comparing test patches against in-image references to refine anomaly detection.

Result: Extensive experiments show SNARM's superior performance on various benchmarks, improving on metrics like Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.

Conclusion: SNARM achieves state-of-the-art performance in industrial anomaly detection.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Self-Navigated Residual Mamba (SNARM), a novel
framework for universal industrial anomaly detection that leverages
``self-referential learning'' within test images to enhance anomaly
discrimination. Unlike conventional methods that depend solely on pre-trained
features from normal training data, SNARM dynamically refines anomaly detection
by iteratively comparing test patches against adaptively selected in-image
references. Specifically, we first compute the ``inter-residuals'' features by
contrasting test image patches with the training feature bank. Patches
exhibiting small-norm residuals (indicating high normality) are then utilized
as self-generated reference patches to compute ``intra-residuals'', amplifying
discriminative signals. These inter- and intra-residual features are
concatenated and fed into a novel Mamba module with multiple heads, which are
dynamically navigated by residual properties to focus on anomalous regions.
Finally, AD results are obtained by aggregating the outputs of a self-navigated
Mamba in an ensemble learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD,
MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that SNARM achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, with notable improvements in all metrics, including
Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.

Method: 引入了一种新颖的双适配器结构，包括时空模态适配器（STMA）和渐进模态互补适配器（PMCA）模块。STMA用于自我提示调整从冻结的骨干网络提取的时空特征，以实现更好的跨模态融合。PMCA通过两个设计独特的像素级浅层和深层适配器来逐步促进跨模态的提示。

Result: DMTrack以不到0.93M的可训练参数实现了出色的性能，在五个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: DMTrack在五个基准上的实验表明，其达到了最先进的结果。该方法使用不到0.93M个可训练参数，表现出了优异的时空多模态跟踪性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter
architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key
of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a
spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality
complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality
alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone
by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different
modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to
facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed
pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared
parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow
between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following
modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused
information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates
modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such
designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking
performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive
experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art
results. Code will be available.

Conclusion: CLIMD框架在处理不平衡的多模态医学数据中表现优异，并且可以轻松地集成到其他模型中，提高了多模态疾病诊断的准确性。

Abstract: Clinicians usually combine information from multiple sources to achieve the
most accurate diagnosis, and this has sparked increasing interest in leveraging
multimodal deep learning for diagnosis. However, in real clinical scenarios,
due to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face
the issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the
features of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with
resampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or
underfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we
propose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis
(CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that
combines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal
complementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually
adapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class
distribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model
to progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training.
Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various
metrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data. Furthermore,
as a plug-and-play CL framework, CLIMD can be easily integrated into other
models, offering a promising path for improving multimodal disease diagnosis
accuracy. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/KHan-UJS/CLIMD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤子类型的细粒度分类依赖于组织病理学全片图像，由于形态变化微妙且注释数据稀缺，分类非常具有挑战性。虽然视觉语言模型的零样本分类具有潜力，但捕捉细粒度病理特征的能力有限，导致子类型区分效果较差。

Method: 提出了细粒度图块对齐网络（FG-PAN），是一种针对数字病理学的零样本框架。FG-PAN包括两个关键模块：（1）局部特征优化模块，通过建模代表性图块之间的空间关系来增强图块级视觉特征；（2）细粒度文本描述生成模块，利用大型语言模型生成病理感知、特定类别的语义原型。通过将优化的视觉特征与大型语言模型生成的细粒度描述相对齐，FG-PAN有效提高了视觉和语义空间中的类别可分性。

Result: FG-PAN在包括EBRAINS和TCGA在内的多个公共病理学数据集上的大量实验中，实现了零样本脑肿瘤子类型分类的最新性能和强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FG-PAN通过将优化的视觉特征与细粒度文本描述相对齐，提高了类别在视觉和语义空间中的可分性，解决了脑肿瘤子类型细粒度分类中的若干挑战。

Abstract: The fine-grained classification of brain tumor subtypes from
histopathological whole slide images is highly challenging due to subtle
morphological variations and the scarcity of annotated data. Although
vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their
ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited,
resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we
propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot
framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules:
(1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features
by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a
fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language
models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By
aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions,
FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic
spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including
EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance
and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.

Motivation: 尽管现有的顶尖方法通过部分参数微调预训练模型，但这些在有限生成器上训练的参数可能无法推广到未知生成器。

Method: 提出了一种适应性强的新框架——图像自适应提示学习（IAPL），包括条件信息学习器和信心驱动的自适应预测两个模块。

Result: 实验表明，IAPL在UniversalFakeDetect和GenImage数据集上均达到了最新水平的性能，平均准确率分别是95.61%和96.7%。

Conclusion: IAPL展现了出色的性能，在检测AI生成的假图像任务中达到了95.61%和96.7%的平均准确率。

Abstract: A major struggle for AI-generated image detection is identifying fake images
from unseen generators. Existing cutting-edge methods typically customize
pre-trained foundation models to this task via partial-parameter fine-tuning.
However, these parameters trained on a narrow range of generators may fail to
generalize to unknown sources. In light of this, we propose a novel framework
named Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), which enhances flexibility in
processing diverse testing images. It consists of two adaptive modules, i.e.,
the Conditional Information Learner and the Confidence-Driven Adaptive
Prediction. The former employs CNN-based feature extractors to learn
forgery-specific and image-specific conditions, which are then propagated to
learnable tokens via a gated mechanism. The latter optimizes the shallowest
learnable tokens based on a single test sample and selects the cropped view
with the highest prediction confidence for final detection. These two modules
enable the prompts fed into the foundation model to be automatically adjusted
based on the input image, rather than being fixed after training, thereby
enhancing the model's adaptability to various forged images. Extensive
experiments show that IAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 95.61%
and 96.7% mean accuracy on two widely used UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage
datasets, respectively.

Motivation: 近年来大型语言模型（LLMs）的发展为图像地理定位提供了新的可能性，但其在此方面的能力尚未充分探索。为此，研究引入了一个新的基准来评估LLMs在图像地理定位任务中的表现。

Method: 引入一个名为IMAGEO-Bench的基准，系统地评估LLMs在精度、距离误差、地理空间偏差和推理过程中的表现。该基准涵盖了全球街景、美国的兴趣点和一个私人收藏的未公开图像的数据集。

Result: 研究显示，封闭源代码模型普遍表现出更强的推理能力。LLMs在高资源地区表现较好，而在欠资源地区表现变差。回归分析表明，成功的地理定位主要依赖于对城市环境、户外环境、街道级图像和可识别地标的识别。

Conclusion: 通过对当前10种最先进的大型语言模型进行实验，揭示了性能差异，尤其是封闭源代码的模型表现出更强的推理能力。同时，我们发现LLMs在高资源地区（如北美、西欧和加利福尼亚）的性能更好，而在欠代表地区表现较差。最佳的地理定位依赖于识别城市环境、户外环境、街道级图像和标志性地标。

Abstract: Image geolocalization, the task of identifying the geographic location
depicted in an image, is important for applications in crisis response, digital
forensics, and location-based intelligence. While recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for visual reasoning, their
ability to perform image geolocalization remains underexplored. In this study,
we introduce a benchmark called IMAGEO-Bench that systematically evaluates
accuracy, distance error, geospatial bias, and reasoning process. Our benchmark
includes three diverse datasets covering global street scenes, points of
interest (POIs) in the United States, and a private collection of unseen
images. Through experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-
and closed-source models, we reveal clear performance disparities, with
closed-source models generally showing stronger reasoning. Importantly, we
uncover geospatial biases as LLMs tend to perform better in high-resource
regions (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and California) while exhibiting
degraded performance in underrepresented areas. Regression diagnostics
demonstrate that successful geolocalization is primarily dependent on
recognizing urban settings, outdoor environments, street-level imagery, and
identifiable landmarks. Overall, IMAGEO-Bench provides a rigorous lens into the
spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and offers implications for building
geolocation-aware AI systems.

designed by MPEG, provides a generic framework for compressing diverse types of
point clouds while ensuring interoperability across applications and devices.
However, G-PCC underperforms compared to recent deep learning-based PCC methods
despite its lower computational power consumption. To enhance the efficiency of
G-PCC without sacrificing its interoperability or computational flexibility, we
propose a novel preprocessing framework that integrates a compression-oriented
voxelization network with a differentiable G-PCC surrogate model, jointly
optimized in the training phase. The surrogate model mimics the rate-distortion
behaviour of the non-differentiable G-PCC codec, enabling end-to-end gradient
propagation. The versatile voxelization network adaptively transforms input
point clouds using learning-based voxelization and effectively manipulates
point clouds via global scaling, fine-grained pruning, and point-level editing
for rate-distortion trade-offs. During inference, only the lightweight
voxelization network is appended to the G-PCC encoder, requiring no
modifications to the decoder, thus introducing no computational overhead for
end users. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 38.84% average BD-rate reduction
over G-PCC. By bridging classical codecs with deep learning, this work offers a
practical pathway to enhance legacy compression standards while preserving
their backward compatibility, making it ideal for real-world deployment.

Abstract: We address the problem of glass surface segmentation with an RGB-D camera,
with a focus on effectively fusing RGB and depth information. To this end, we
propose a Weighted Feature Fusion (WFF) module that dynamically and adaptively
combines RGB and depth features to tackle issues such as transparency,
reflections, and occlusions. This module can be seamlessly integrated with
various deep neural network backbones as a plug-and-play solution.
Additionally, we introduce the MJU-Glass dataset, a comprehensive RGB-D dataset
collected by a service robot navigating real-world environments, providing a
valuable benchmark for evaluating segmentation models. Experimental results
show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness, with the
WFF module enhancing performance in both mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)
and boundary IoU (bIoU), achieving a 7.49% improvement in bIoU when integrated
with PSPNet. The proposed module and dataset provide a robust framework for
advancing glass surface segmentation in robotics and reducing the risk of
collisions with glass objects.

### [100] [Minimal High-Resolution Patches Are Sufficient for Whole Slide Image Representation via Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01641)
*Yujian Liu,Yuechuan Lin,Dongxu Shen,Haoran Li,Yutong Wang,Xiaoli Liu,Shidang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CDSR通过减少高分辨率图像块数量，提高了分类任务的性能，比当前的方法更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的MIL方法主要强调Aggregator设计，忽略了由特征提取器导致的领域差异和次优表现。因此，需要一种方法来缩小领域差异并提高代表性。

Method: 提出了一个级联双尺度重建框架（CDSR），采用两个阶段的选择性采样策略，重建空间一致的高分辨率全切片图像表示。

Result: CDSR在Camelyon16、TCGA-NSCLC和TCGA-RCC数据集上进行实验，与超过1000万图像块训练的现有最先进方法相比，平均每个数据集仅使用7070个高分辨率图像块，准确性提高了6.3%，ROC曲线下面积提高了5.5%。

Conclusion: CDSR方法通过显著减少所需的高分辨率图像块数，提高了下游分类任务的准确性和ROC曲线下面积，与现有的最先进方法相比性能更优。

Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel
scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level
prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while
overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction
stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap
and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown
promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds
upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches.
This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and
interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and
drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a
Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an
average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust
slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling
strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both
model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a
Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution
WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global
contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR
is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on
Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves
improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream
classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches
per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over
10,000,000 patches.

Abstract: Realistic hair strand generation is crucial for applications like computer
graphics and virtual reality. While diffusion models can generate hairstyles
from text or images, these inputs lack precision and user-friendliness.
Instead, we propose the first sketch-based strand generation model, which
offers finer control while remaining user-friendly. Our framework tackles key
challenges, such as modeling complex strand interactions and diverse sketch
patterns, through two main innovations: a learnable strand upsampling strategy
that encodes 3D strands into multi-scale latent spaces, and a multi-scale
adaptive conditioning mechanism using a transformer with diffusion heads to
ensure consistency across granularity levels. Experiments on several benchmark
datasets show our method outperforms existing approaches in realism and
precision. Qualitative results further confirm its effectiveness. Code will be
released at [GitHub](https://github.com/fighting-Zhang/StrandDesigner).

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于扩散模型的3D物体可行为地检测框架，通过利用文本到图像的内部表示来进行3D可行为预测，解决了现有方法泛化性差的问题。

Abstract: 3D object affordance grounding aims to predict the touchable regions on a 3d
object, which is crucial for human-object interaction, human-robot interaction,
embodied perception, and robot learning. Recent advances tackle this problem
via learning from demonstration images. However, these methods fail to capture
the general affordance knowledge within the image, leading to poor
generalization. To address this issue, we propose to use text-to-image
diffusion models to extract the general affordance knowledge because we find
that such models can generate semantically valid HOI images, which demonstrate
that their internal representation space is highly correlated with real-world
affordance concepts. Specifically, we introduce the DAG, a diffusion-based 3d
affordance grounding framework, which leverages the frozen internal
representations of the text-to-image diffusion model and unlocks affordance
knowledge within the diffusion model to perform 3D affordance grounding. We
further introduce an affordance block and a multi-source affordance decoder to
endow 3D dense affordance prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show
that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world
generalization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用地图级视角的无训练解码方法，旨在减少大规模视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题，通过地图级注意处理提高事实一致性，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在多模态任务中取得了显著成绩，但仍然存在幻觉问题，即生成语法上准确但与视觉输入不一致的内容。

Method: 我们提出了一种无训练的解码方法，称为地图级注意处理(MAP)，通过注意力为基础的地图级操作，有效利用事实信息以提高事实一致性。具体而言，我们使用逐层交叉注意力，在每个解码层通过聚合来自层间和层内维度的tokens逐步精化token表示。此外，全局-局部对数融合机制结合了全局注意力前后获得的对数，以进一步精炼预测和提高准确性。

Result: 我们的方法在多个基准测试上改善了LVLMs的真实性和准确性，验证了地图级解码策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在多个基准测试（如POPE、MME、和MMHal-Bench）上持续改进了LVLMs的真实性和表现，显示了地图级解码策略的潜力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
multimodal tasks, but they still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating
content that is grammatically accurate but inconsistent with visual inputs. In
this work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate
hallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D
semantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across
this map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted
by most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise
consistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention
Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages
factual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve
factual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention
to progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by
aggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a
Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after
global attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy. Our method
consistently improves the truthfulness and performance of LVLMs across
benchmarks, such as POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrating the potential of
the map-level decoding strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VELA的新方法，用于在仅需单点提示下实现高效的无模式分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无模式分割方法依赖强提示，难以处理复杂遮挡情况，且缺乏几何解释性。希望通过开发新方法解决这些问题。

Method: VELA方法是基于速度驱动的水平集无模式分割方法，利用点提示从图像特征构建初始水平集函数，再通过形状特定运动场引导演化为最终无模式面罩。

Result: VELA在COCOA-cls, D2SA和KINS基准上的表现优于现有方法，验证了几何模型在弱提示下的有效性。

Conclusion: VELA方法在弱提示下实现了解释几何建模的有效性，其在多个基准上的性能优于现有的强提示方法。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation aims to recover complete object shapes, including
occluded regions with no visual appearance, whereas conventional segmentation
focuses solely on visible areas. Existing methods typically rely on strong
prompts, such as visible masks or bounding boxes, which are costly or
impractical to obtain in real-world settings. While recent approaches such as
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) support point-based prompts for guidance, they
often perform direct mask regression without explicitly modeling shape
evolution, limiting generalization in complex occlusion scenarios. Moreover,
most existing methods suffer from a black-box nature, lacking geometric
interpretability and offering limited insight into how occluded shapes are
inferred. To deal with these limitations, we propose VELA, an end-to-end
VElocity-driven Level-set Amodal segmentation method that performs explicit
contour evolution from point-based prompts. VELA first constructs an initial
level set function from image features and the point input, which then
progressively evolves into the final amodal mask under the guidance of a
shape-specific motion field predicted by a fully differentiable network. This
network learns to generate evolution dynamics at each step, enabling
geometrically grounded and topologically flexible contour modeling. Extensive
experiments on COCOA-cls, D2SA, and KINS benchmarks demonstrate that VELA
outperforms existing strongly prompted methods while requiring only a
single-point prompt, validating the effectiveness of interpretable geometric
modeling under weak guidance. The code will be publicly released.

TL;DR: 提出ShapeMoE，通过形状分布动态选择专家，提高遮挡区域分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对遮挡和形状变化大的物体，现有的通用方法单一模型难以处理所有形状类型，表现有限。采用专家混合模型为不同形状模式分配专家是一种解决方案，但需要考虑对象的底层形状分布。

Method: 提出ShapeMoE，一个形状特定的稀疏专家混合模型。通过学习潜在形状分布空间动态选择最适合的轻量级专家。ShapeMoE将对象编码成紧凑的高斯嵌入，使用形状感知稀疏路由器映射到最合适的专家。

Result: ShapeMoE在实验中表现优于最先进的方法，特别是在遮挡区域分割方面。

Conclusion: ShapeMoE提供清晰的形状与专家之间的对应关系，并在高容量和效率方面表现优异。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation targets to predict complete object masks, covering both
visible and occluded regions. This task poses significant challenges due to
complex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly
deformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single
model to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse
amodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to
adopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different
shape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's
underlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and
insufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized
experts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific
sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to
learn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a
lightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically,
ShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures
key shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to
the most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert
routing. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting
occluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well
interpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining
high capacity and efficiency. Experiments on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA show
that ShapeMoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
occluded region segmentation. The code will be released.

TL;DR: Rein++是一种基于VFM的高效语义分割框架，通过解决数据量差异和域分布偏移问题，展示了优越的泛化和适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉基础模型在语义分割上的应用面临挑战：分割数据集与VFM预训练数据规模差异大，以及实际分割场景的数据分布偏移。为克服这些限制，引入Rein++框架实现有限数据的优越泛化能力和对多样化未标记场景的有效适应。

Method: 该方法包括两大方案：Rein-G（域泛化方案）引入可训练的实例感知token，精细调整VFM的特征以适应分割任务，并仅微调不到1%的骨干网络参数；Rein-A（域适应方案）在实例和logit层面进行无监督域适应，以缓解域偏移，还包含一个语义转移模块，利用全景分割模型的类无关能力加强目标域的边界细节。

Result: 实验表明，Rein++ 在有效训练中显著超越了当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: Rein++显著优于当前最先进的方法，提供了一种高效、可泛化和自适应的视觉基础模型语义分割解决方案，即使面对拥有数十亿参数的大型模型。

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models(VFMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
computer vision tasks. However, their application to semantic segmentation is
hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as
segmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM
pre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation
scenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To
overcome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based
segmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited
data and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.
Specifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a
domain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,
instance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the
segmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of
the backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the
Rein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and
logit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic
transfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment
anything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated
Rein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,
daytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,
nighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with
efficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and
adaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of
parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/wloves/Rein.

Conclusion: PatchMap能有效提升对视觉模型的攻击成功率，同时为研究定位感知防御和自适应攻击提供了工具。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks threaten the reliability of modern vision models.
We present PatchMap, the first spatially exhaustive benchmark of patch
placement, built by evaluating over 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet validation
images. PatchMap reveals systematic hot-spots where small patches (as little as
2% of the image) induce confident misclassifications and large drops in model
confidence. To demonstrate its utility, we propose a simple segmentation guided
placement heuristic that leverages off the shelf masks to identify vulnerable
regions without any gradient queries. Across five architectures-including
adversarially trained ResNet50, our method boosts attack success rates by 8 to
13 percentage points compared to random or fixed placements. We publicly
release PatchMap and the code implementation. The full PatchMap bench (6.5B
predictions, multiple backbones) will be released soon to further accelerate
research on location-aware defenses and adaptive attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉-语言模型的多模态信息对齐问题，减少幻觉现象。

Method: 将文本指令直接嵌入图像中，强制模型通过视觉渠道处理所有内容，省去单独文本输入。

Result: Prompt-in-Image提高了Qwen2.5-VL的表现，将POPE准确性提高了4.1%，同时在MS-COCO上减少了幻觉率。而LLaVA-1.5和InstructBLIP则出现严重性能下降，准确性接近随机水平。

Conclusion: Prompt-in-Image improve视觉-语言模型性能，尤其是Qwen2.5-VL，提高准确性并减少幻觉出现率，但对LLaVA和InstructBLIP则导致性能下降。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from hallucination, partly due to
challenges in aligning multimodal information. We propose Prompt-in-Image, a
simple method that embeds textual instructions directly into images. This
removes the need for separate text inputs and forces the model to process all
content through the visual channel. We evaluate this method on three popular
open-source VLMs: Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InstructBLIP. The results reveal
sharp differences. Prompt-in-Image improves Qwen2.5-VL's performance,
increasing POPE accuracy by 4.1 percent (from 80.2 percent to 84.3 percent) and
also reducing hallucination rates on MS-COCO. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and
InstructBLIP experience a severe performance drop, with accuracy falling from
around 84 percent to near-random levels. Through detailed analysis, we found
that CLIP-based encoders in LLaVA and InstructBLIP exhibit excessive attention
bias toward embedded text regions, disrupting visual understanding. In
contrast, Qwen's vision encoder handles text-embedded images robustly.
Crucially, Prompt-in-Image reduces Qwen's modality gap, enhancing cross-modal
alignment by unifying information processing through a single modality.

Motivation: 虽然扩散模型在2D图像生成和编辑方面取得了显著进展，但将这些能力扩展到3D编辑时面临挑战，尤其是要保持多视图一致性问题。

Method: 提出DisCo3D，通过一致性蒸馏训练2D编辑器，并通过高斯散射将编辑的多视图输出优化为3D表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，DisCo3D实现了稳定的多视图一致性，在编辑质量上优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: DisCo3D框架有效解决了在复杂场景中多视图一致性差的问题，提高了3D编辑的效率和质量。

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in 2D image
generation and editing, extending these capabilities to 3D editing remains
challenging, particularly in maintaining multi-view consistency. Classical
approaches typically update 3D representations through iterative refinement
based on a single editing view. However, these methods often suffer from slow
convergence and blurry artifacts caused by cross-view inconsistencies. Recent
methods improve efficiency by propagating 2D editing attention features, yet
still exhibit fine-grained inconsistencies and failure modes in complex scenes
due to insufficient constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{DisCo3D},
a novel framework that distills 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor. Our
method first fine-tunes a 3D generator using multi-view inputs for scene
adaptation, then trains a 2D editor through consistency distillation. The
edited multi-view outputs are finally optimized into 3D representations via
Gaussian Splatting. Experimental results show DisCo3D achieves stable
multi-view consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing
quality.

<details>

Motivation: 图像注册中的核心挑战是建立像素/体素级或区域级的对应关系。传统方法通常分为两步：在每幅图像中分割ROI，然后进行匹配。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的方法，简化为一步，直接“寻找对应的提示”，使用经过广泛预训练的分割模型进行训练无需求的注册。引入了“对应提示问题”，通过“逆提示”解决方案生成主要和可选的辅助提示，通过边际化逆提示注册算法识别多个对应的ROI。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个简化图像注册的创新方法，不需要训练数据且在多个应用领域中表现优异。

Abstract: Establishing pixel/voxel-level or region-level correspondences is the core
challenge in image registration. The latter, also known as region-based
correspondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to
enable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at
pixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two
steps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images.
In this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly "searching for
corresponding prompts", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models
(e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we
introduce the "corresponding prompt problem", which aims to identify a
corresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X,
such that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of
corresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an "inverse
prompt" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts,
inverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a
novel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs
by marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial
dimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of
registering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and,
as a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and
target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration
outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based
DDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with
weakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data.

Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在文本、图像、结构图和运动轨迹作为条件引导下取得了视频生成的成功，但在给定视频首尾帧及描述性文本提示的过渡视频生成方面探索不足，因此提出VTG框架进行改进。

Method: VTG通过插值初始化、双向运动微调和表示对齐正则化来提高视频过渡的生成质量。

coherent video transitions. VTG introduces interpolation-based initialization
that helps preserve object identity and handle abrupt content changes
effectively. In addition, it incorporates dual-directional motion fine-tuning
and representation alignment regularization to mitigate the limitations of
pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models in motion smoothness and generation
fidelity, respectively. To evaluate VTG and facilitate future studies on
unified transition generation, we collected TransitBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for transition generation covering two representative transition
tasks: concept blending and scene transition. Extensive experiments show that
VTG achieves superior transition performance consistently across all four
tasks.

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法，TimeExpert，提高视频事件评级任务的效率和效果，达到最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频大模型在处理任务时没有区分不同子任务的特殊需求，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出TimeExpert，这是一种基于专家混合模型的Video-LLM，通过动态路由任务特定令牌到专业专家，提升计算效率。

Result: TimeExpert在多个VTG任务中实现了最先进的性能，如视频密集字幕、片段检索和视频亮点检测。

Conclusion: TimeExpert能够精确处理每个子任务，增强事件建模效果。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to precisely identify video event
segments in response to textual queries. The outputs of VTG tasks manifest as
sequences of events, each defined by precise timestamps, saliency scores, and
textual descriptions. Despite recent advances, a fundamental limitation
persists in existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs): they process all
task tokens through identical and static pathways, failing to recognize that
temporal localization, saliency assessment, and textual generation represent
fundamentally distinct tasks requiring specialized processing. To address this,
we introduce TimeExpert, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Video-LLM that
effectively decomposes VTG tasks by dynamically routing task-specific tokens
(e.g., timestamps, saliency scores) to specialized experts, with increased
computational efficiency. Our design choices enable precise handling of each
subtask, leading to improved event modeling across diverse VTG applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeExpert consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance on various VTG tasks such as Dense Video
Captioning, Moment Retrieval, and Video Highlight Detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D-GS地图更新的LT-Gaussian方法，能够处理结构变化并高效更新地图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶系统中，更新地图的时间和计算成本是一个显著的挑战。

Method: LT-Gaussian由多模态高斯倾洒、结构变化检测模块和高斯图更新模块三个主要组件构成。

Result: 实验结果表明，LT-Gaussian能够产生比从头开始重建地图策略更高质量的重建结果。

Conclusion: LT-Gaussian能够有效高效地更新基于3D-GS的地图，并可以处理自动驾驶场景中的常见环境变化。

Abstract: Maps play an important role in autonomous driving systems. The recently
proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) produces rendering-quality explicit
scene reconstruction results, demonstrating the potential for map construction
in autonomous driving scenarios. However, because of the time and computational
costs involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a
significant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update
method for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components:
Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and
Gaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is
generated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently,
during the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the
current LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform
targeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We
establish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to
quantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that
LT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling
common environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by
taking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian
is able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update
strategies that reconstruct maps from scratch. Our open-source code is
available at https://github.com/ChengLuqi/LT-gaussian.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAID框架通过细粒度融合与语义扰动提高文本到视频检索的表现，在多个数据集上取得了显著的效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在文本到视频检索中主要利用视觉线索，往往忽略了音频语义或采用粗粒度融合策略，导致子优化的多模态表示。GAID旨在通过精细的融合策略和语义扰动解决此问题，以提高检索表现的表达能力和稳健性。

Method: GAID框架通过两个主要组件进行创新：帧级门控融合（FGF），用于在文字引导下自适应整合音频和视觉特征，实现细粒度的时序对齐；以及方向性自适应语义扰动（DASP），通过在文本嵌入中注入结构感知的扰动来增强鲁棒性和辨别能力，而无需多通道推理。

Result: 在MSR-VTT、DiDeMo、LSMDC和VATEX数据集上进行的广泛实验证明，GAID在所有检索指标上都取得了稳定的最新结果，并实现了显著的效率提升。

Conclusion: GAID展示了一种有效的文本到视频检索框架，通过结合FGF和DASP模块实现稳健的多模态表示，并在多个数据集上达到了最新的结果和效率提升。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval requires precise alignment between language and
temporally rich video signals. Existing methods predominantly exploit visual
cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion
strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID,
a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a
Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual
features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and
(ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects
structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and
discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement
each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes
cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations.
Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent
state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency
gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangBowenn/GAID.

Conclusion: HateClipSeg数据集的发布提供了一种多模态视频中检测仇恨言论的新方式，展示了现有模型在精确度上的不足，呼吁开发更先进的检测方法。

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in videos remains challenging due to the complexity of
multimodal content and the lack of fine-grained annotations in existing

video-level and segment-level annotations, comprising over 11,714 segments
labeled as Normal or across five Offensive categories: Hateful, Insulting,
Sexual, Violence, Self-Harm, along with explicit target victim labels. Our
three-stage annotation process yields high inter-annotator agreement
(Krippendorff's alpha = 0.817). We propose three tasks to benchmark
performance: (1) Trimmed Hateful Video Classification, (2) Temporal Hateful
Video Localization, and (3) Online Hateful Video Classification. Results
highlight substantial gaps in current models, emphasizing the need for more
sophisticated multimodal and temporally aware approaches. The HateClipSeg

Method: 在现有的TOPICS方法上进行扩展，提出TOPICS+，其包括Dice损失在层级损失公式中的应用、分层伪标签的引入，以及为机器人手术环境设计量身定制的标签分类法。

Conclusion: 我们提出了TOPICS+方法，该方法在手术场景中实现了稳健的分割性能。这一改进方法在层级损失中引入了Dice loss来处理类不平衡，并采用了分层伪标签，同时为机器人手术环境设计了特定的标签分类法。

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding
to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on
static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and
evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS)
allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work,
we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized
Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced
variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of
surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical
loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical
pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery
environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic
surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic
categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical
environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than
144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an
evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at

Motivation: 深度视觉模型通过层次架构取得了显著的分类性能，使得人类可解释的概念通过跨层的单个神经元构成得以涌现。由于表示的分布性，准确定位特定视觉概念在模型中的编码位置仍是一个重要且具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 本文提出了一种有效的电路发现方法，称为颗粒度概念电路（GCC），其中每个电路代表与给定查询相关的概念。通过我们的方法，构建电路的过程为：迭代评估神经元之间的连接，重点关注功能性依赖和语义对齐。

Result: 我们的方法能够自动发现多个电路，每个电路捕捉到查询中的具体概念。这种方法提供了深刻的概念层面模型解释，并首次在细粒度水平识别与特定视觉概念相关的电路。我们验证了GCC在各种深度图像分类模型中的通用性和有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的GCC方法能够有效地发现深度视觉模型中的概念电路，为模型提供了概念化的解释，验证了其在多种图像分类模型中的应用能力。

Abstract: Deep vision models have achieved remarkable classification performance by
leveraging a hierarchical architecture in which human-interpretable concepts
emerge through the composition of individual neurons across layers. Given the
distributed nature of representations, pinpointing where specific visual
concepts are encoded within a model remains a crucial yet challenging task. In
this paper, we introduce an effective circuit discovery method, called Granular
Concept Circuit (GCC), in which each circuit represents a concept relevant to a
given query. To construct each circuit, our method iteratively assesses
inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on both functional dependencies and
semantic alignment. By automatically discovering multiple circuits, each
capturing specific concepts within that query, our approach offers a profound,
concept-wise interpretation of models and is the first to identify circuits
tied to specific visual concepts at a fine-grained level. We validate the
versatility and effectiveness of GCCs across various deep image classification
models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种AMOT方法，通过联合利用外观和运动线索有效改善无人机视频中的多目标跟踪性能，在多个基准上优于最先进的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机视频中频繁的视角变化和复杂的无人机地面相对运动动态导致不稳定的亲和力测量和模糊的关联。现有方法通常将运动和外观线索分开建模，忽视了它们的时空相互作用，导致跟踪性能不佳。为了解决这些问题，提出了AMOT方法。

Method: AMOT方法包含两个关键组件：外观运动一致性（AMC）矩阵和运动感知轨迹延续（MTC）模块。AMC矩阵通过外观特征引导计算双向空间一致性，增强身份关联的可靠性。MTC模块通过外观引导的预测补充AMC，以减少由于漏检导致的轨迹中断。

Result: 在三个无人机基准上（包括VisDrone2019、UAVDT和VT-MOT-UAV），AMOT方法的实验结果证明其性能优于当前的最先进方法，并且能够以插件式和无需训练的方式很好地泛化。

Conclusion: AMOT方法能有效改善无人机视频中的多目标跟踪性能，优于现有最先进的方法，并且具有良好的通用性，不需要额外的训练步骤。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to track multiple objects while maintaining
consistent identities across frames of a given video. In unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex
UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often
lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing
methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking
their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking
performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance
and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency
(AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically,
the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance
of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity
association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks
through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions,
thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive
experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and
VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.

TL;DR: SpectralX框架有效适应现有RSFMs处理光谱影像，并提高了领域泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光学影像预训练模型无需大规模谱预训练即可处理多样化的谱模态，利用光谱影像的优势进行地球观测。

Method: 通过引入参数高效的微调框架SpectralX，采用两阶段训练方法即遮罩重构任务及专用属性标记器，并进行层次化微调。

Result: SpectralX提高了RSFMs对新地区或季节光谱影像的解释能力。

Conclusion: SpectralX显著提高了领域泛化性能，使得RSFMs能够解释来自不同地区或季节的光谱影像。

Abstract: Recent advances in Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) have led to
significant breakthroughs in the field. While many RSFMs have been pretrained
with massive optical imagery, more multispectral/hyperspectral data remain lack
of the corresponding foundation models. To leverage the advantages of spectral
imagery in earth observation, we explore whether existing RSFMs can be
effectively adapted to process diverse spectral modalities without requiring
extensive spectral pretraining. In response to this challenge, we proposed
SpectralX, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapt
existing RSFMs as backbone while introducing a two-stage training approach to
handle various spectral inputs, thereby significantly improving domain
generalization performance. In the first stage, we employ a
masked-reconstruction task and design a specialized Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) to
extract attribute tokens from both spatial and spectral dimensions.
Simultaneously, we develop an Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA)
that dynamically aggregates multi-attribute expert knowledge while performing
layer-wise fine-tuning. With semantic segmentation as downstream task in the
second stage, we insert an Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter) into the
first stage framework. By iteratively querying low-level semantic features with
high-level representations, the model learns to focus on task-beneficial
attributes, enabling customized adjustment of RSFMs. Following this two-phase
adaptation process, SpectralX is capable of interpreting spectral imagery from
new regions or seasons. The codes will be available from the website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AG$^2$aussian framework improves 3D Gaussian semantic representation using anchor-graph structure, enhancing applications in scene understanding and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the growing need for precise semantic-aware 3D Gaussian representations due to their increasing use in diverse applications, which current methods fail to adequately provide.

Method: The method involves using an anchor-graph structure to organize and regulate Gaussian primitives for better semantic feature management.

Result: The proposed framework shows advantages over existing methods, achieving better organization and selection of semantic 3D Gaussians, as validated through four application tests.

Conclusion: AG$^2$aussian framework successfully addresses the noise and messiness in semantic features of 3D Gaussian representations by using an anchor-graph structure.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has witnessed exponential adoption across
diverse applications, driving a critical need for semantic-aware 3D Gaussian
representations to enable scene understanding and editing tasks. Existing
approaches typically attach semantic features to a collection of free Gaussians
and distill the features via differentiable rendering, leading to noisy
segmentation and a messy selection of Gaussians. In this paper, we introduce
AG$^2$aussian, a novel framework that leverages an anchor-graph structure to
organize semantic features and regulate Gaussian primitives. Our anchor-graph
structure not only promotes compact and instance-aware Gaussian distributions,
but also facilitates graph-based propagation, achieving a clean and accurate
instance-level Gaussian selection. Extensive validation across four
applications, i.e. interactive click-based query, open-vocabulary text-driven
query, object removal editing, and physics simulation, demonstrates the
advantages of our approach and its benefits to various applications. The
experiments and ablation studies further evaluate the effectiveness of the key
designs of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文章揭示，通过SEA攻击方法，可以有效利用开源视觉语言模型的漏洞，使微调模型易受攻击，从而展示了保护专有VLMs免受可转移漏洞威胁的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调开源视觉语言模型（VLMs）可能保留基础模型中的漏洞，使其容易受到可转移的越狱攻击。考虑到这一风险，研究动机在于证明这一潜在威胁并寻求解决方案。

Method: 该研究提出了一种新的灰盒越狱方法，即模拟集成攻击（SEA）。攻击者完全访问基础VLM，但无权查看目标模型的权重或训练配置。SEA结合了微调轨迹模拟（FTS）和目标提示指导（TPG）两种技术，其中FTS通过模拟视觉编码器的参数变动生成可转移的对抗性图像，而TPG则是一种文本策略，旨在引导语言解码器输出对抗性优化的结果。

Result: 实验表明，SEA在Qwen2-VL系列模型（2B和7B）上的攻击成功率超过86.5%，而毒性率接近49.5%，这适用于多种经过微调的变体，包括那些专门调试以提升安全性能的模型。此外，在微调VLMs上直接基于PGD的图像越狱罕见转移时，SEA能够可靠地利用基础模型继承的漏洞，大幅提升转移性。

Conclusion: 研究指出，需要保护经过微调的专有视觉语言模型（VLM）免受来源于开源基础模型的可转移漏洞的威胁。这标志着应开发全面的防御措施贯穿整个模型生命周期。

Abstract: Fine-tuning open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) creates a critical yet
underexplored attack surface: vulnerabilities in the base VLM could be retained
in fine-tuned variants, rendering them susceptible to transferable jailbreak
attacks. To demonstrate this risk, we introduce the Simulated Ensemble Attack
(SEA), a novel grey-box jailbreak method in which the adversary has full access
to the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target's weights or training
configuration. To improve jailbreak transferability across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA
combines two key techniques: Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and
Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG). FTS generates transferable adversarial images
by simulating the vision encoder's parameter shifts, while TPG is a textual
strategy that steers the language decoder toward adversarially optimized
outputs. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family (2B and 7B) demonstrate that SEA
achieves high transfer attack success rates exceeding 86.5% and toxicity rates
near 49.5% across diverse fine-tuned variants, even those specifically
fine-tuned to improve safety behaviors. Notably, while direct PGD-based image
jailbreaks rarely transfer across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA reliably exploits
inherited vulnerabilities from the base model, significantly enhancing
transferability. These findings highlight an urgent need to safeguard
fine-tuned proprietary VLMs against transferable vulnerabilities inherited from
open-source foundations, motivating the development of holistic defenses across
the entire model lifecycle.

Motivation: 现有方法在细粒度视觉线索利用、动词与名词之间的语义依赖、显式认知推理等方面存在不足。因此开发一种方法来提高泛化和长期预测能力非常重要。

Method: INSIGHT是一个两阶段的框架。在第一个阶段中，INSIGHT从手-物交互区域中提取语义丰富的特征，并使用动词-名词共现矩阵来增强动作表示。在第二个阶段，它引入了一个基于强化学习的模块，通过结构化过程进行显式的认知推理。

Result: INSIGHT在Ego4D、EPIC-Kitchens-55和EGTEA Gaze+基准上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: INSIGHT方法在三个主流数据集上表现出色，展示了其有效性和强泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-term action anticipation from egocentric video is critical for
applications such as human-computer interaction and assistive technologies,
where anticipating user intent enables proactive and context-aware AI
assistance. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: 1)
underutilization of fine-grained visual cues from hand-object interactions, 2)
neglect of semantic dependencies between verbs and nouns, and 3) lack of
explicit cognitive reasoning, limiting generalization and long-term forecasting
ability. To overcome these challenges, we propose INSIGHT, a unified two-stage
framework for egocentric action anticipation. In the first stage, INSIGHT
focuses on extracting semantically rich features from hand-object interaction
regions and enhances action representations using a verb-noun co-occurrence
matrix. In the second stage, it introduces a reinforcement learning-based
module that simulates explicit cognitive reasoning through a structured
process: visual perception (think) -> intention inference (reason) -> action
anticipation (answer). Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and
EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks show that INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.

Method: 提出了一种新颖的框架，通过将采样和优化解耦以改善收敛性，并通过在信息子空间中的匹配来缓解 DP 噪音的影响，从而提高信号质量。

Result: 提出的方法在CIFAR-10上表现优异，与现有最先进的方法相比，每类50张图像时成绩提高10.0%，并在数据集大小缩小为五分之一时提高8.3%。

Conclusion: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，我们的方法在每类50张图像时提高了10.0%，并且在只有前沿方法五分之一的数据集大小时提高了8.3%，展示了在隐私保护的数据集蒸馏方面的显著潜力。

Abstract: Modern machine learning models heavily rely on large datasets that often
include sensitive and private information, raising serious privacy concerns.
Differentially private (DP) data generation offers a solution by creating
synthetic datasets that limit the leakage of private information within a
predefined privacy budget; however, it requires a substantial amount of data to
achieve performance comparable to models trained on the original data. To
mitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation,
Dataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage
efficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with
DP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without
compromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods
suffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on
noisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the
inefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive
noise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples
sampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality
by mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative
subspace. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves a \textbf{10.0\%} improvement with
50 images per class and \textbf{8.3\%} increase with just \textbf{one-fifth}
the distilled set size of previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating
significant potential to advance privacy-preserving DD.

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种独特的多相机实时跟踪系统，用于追踪室内饲养的Holstein Friesian奶牛，能够提高早期疾病预测，并通过活动量化和行为分类改善奶牛的健康和福利。

Abstract: Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making
continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm
productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and
inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique
multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian
dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques,
including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity
seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by
geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The
detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow
dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an
upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for
instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory.
Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman
filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for
object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT
Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two
benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity
switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex
interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces

TL;DR: 提出一种新的导航方式——视觉提示导航（VPN），以视觉提示取代自然语言指导，提高导航性能并减少语言歧义，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言指导对于体智能体在复杂环境中的导航较为冗长且存在歧义。为了改善这一问题，论文提出了视觉提示导航方式，旨在提供一种无需依赖语言指令且更为直观的导航方式。

Method: 采用视觉提示在2D俯视地图中标记导航轨迹，提出了VPN任务，并通过扩展现有数据集构建了两个新的数据集R2R-VP和R2R-CE-VP。还引入了一个基于的基础网络——VPNet，并采用了视图级和轨迹级数据增强策略来提高导航性能。

Result: 实验表明，视觉提示的形式、俯视地图格式以及数据增强策略对视觉提示导航的性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的范式——视觉提示导航（VPN），通过用户提供的视觉提示而非自然语言指导体智能体进行导航。这种方法适合非专家用户，减少了语言指令带来的解释歧义。

Abstract: While natural language is commonly used to guide embodied agents, the
inherent ambiguity and verbosity of language often hinder the effectiveness of
language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose
Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate
using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual
prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a
top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance
without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert
users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete
and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and
R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding
visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network
to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level
augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and
trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from
large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive
experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data
augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation. The

TL;DR: DiffSemanticFusion框架通过融合语义栅格化表示和地图扩散模块改善了自动驾驶中的轨迹预测和规划任务性能，在基准测试中表现优于多个现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要准确的场景理解，包括道路几何、交通参与者及其语义关系。在生成在线高清地图的场景中，栅格化表示适合视觉模型但缺乏几何精度，而图表表示保留了结构细节但在没有精确地图时变得不稳定。为利用两者的优势，本文提出了一种融合框架DiffSemanticFusion，用于多模态轨迹预测和规划。

Method: DiffSemanticFusion框架融合了语义栅格化的鸟瞰图(BEV)空间，并通过地图扩散模块来增强在线高清地图表示的稳定性和表现力。利用两项下游任务进行验证：轨迹预测和面向规划的端到端自动驾驶。

Result: 实验表明，DiffSemanticFusion在真实世界自动驾驶基准测试nuScenes和NAVSIM上的表现超过了多个现有方法。在nuScenes的预测任务中，与在线高清地图知情QCNet进行集成，性能提高了5.1％。在NAVSIM中的端到端自动驾驶中，DiffSemanticFusion达到了最先进的结果，NavHard场景中性能提升了15％。

Conclusion: 通过实验验证，DiffSemanticFusion框架提高了自动驾驶场景中多个任务的性能，并证明地图扩散模块可以无缝集成到其他向量化方法中以提高表现。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires accurate scene understanding, including road
geometry, traffic agents, and their semantic relationships. In online HD map
generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision
models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain
structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the
complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion
framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach
reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion
module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map
representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory
prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on
real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate
improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction
task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map
informed QCNet, achieving a 5.1\% performance improvement. For end-to-end
autonomous driving in NAVSIM, DiffSemanticFusion achieves state-of-the-art
results, with a 15\% performance gain in NavHard scenarios. In addition,
extensive ablation and sensitivity studies show that our map diffusion module
can be seamlessly integrated into other vector-based approaches to enhance
performance. All artifacts are available at

Motivation: 为了在术前计划中准确分割肝脏结构，并减少获取肝脏血管结构先验知识所需的时间。

Method: 提出了一种基于点的方法进行Couinaud分割，并在点特征上添加图推理模块，以实现对肝脏血管结构的推理。

Result: 在Dice系数和平均表面距离得分方面，我们的方法在MSD和LiTS公开数据集上具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 我们的方法通过学习点邻域间的亲和性，成功实现了对肝脏血管结构的隐式推理，并在公开数据集上表现良好。

Abstract: The preoperative planning of liver surgery relies on Couinaud segmentation
from computed tomography (CT) images, to reduce the risk of bleeding and guide
the resection procedure. Using 3D point-based representations, rather than
voxelizing the CT volume, has the benefit of preserving the physical resolution
of the CT. However, point-based representations need prior knowledge of the
liver vessel structure, which is time consuming to acquire. Here, we propose a
point-based method for Couinaud segmentation, without explicitly providing the
prior liver vessel structure. To allow the model to learn this anatomical liver
vessel structure, we add a graph reasoning module on top of the point features.
This adds implicit anatomical information to the model, by learning affinities
across point neighborhoods. Our method is competitive on the MSD and LiTS
public datasets in Dice coefficient and average surface distance scores
compared to four pioneering point-based methods. Our code is available at

Abstract: The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial
technical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of
temporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the
MSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of
signer-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of
CSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed,
centered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline,
and an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled
feature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate
communicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating
DBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel
CSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer
design of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal
dependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for
the spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology
achieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on
the development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd
place ranking on the official competition platform. This research validates the
efficacy of cross-domain architectural adaptation, demonstrating that the
Conformer model, originally conceived for speech recognition, can be
successfully repurposed to establish a new state-of-the-art performance in
keypoint-based CSLR.

Conclusion: 我们的方法通过整合物理知识和扩散模型显著提高了单帧3D手部运动重建方法的性能，实现了现有基准上的状态风性能。

Abstract: While 3D hand reconstruction from monocular images has made significant
progress, generating accurate and temporally coherent motion estimates from
videos remains challenging, particularly during hand-object interactions. In
this paper, we present a novel 3D hand motion recovery framework that enhances
image-based reconstructions through a diffusion-based and physics-augmented
motion refinement model. Our model captures the distribution of refined motion
estimates conditioned on initial ones, generating improved sequences through an
iterative denoising process. Instead of relying on scarce annotated video data,
we train our model only using motion capture data without images. We identify
valuable intuitive physics knowledge during hand-object interactions, including
key motion states and their associated motion constraints. We effectively
integrate these physical insights into our diffusion model to improve its
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves various frame-wise reconstruction methods, achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on existing benchmarks.

first, the unit vector normal to the target plane is determined, followed by
the camera's position vector, its distance to the target plane, and finally,
the full orientation. To improve the method's robustness to measurement noise,
an averaging methodology is introduced to refine the estimation of the target's
normal direction. The accuracy and robustness of the approach are validated

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决事件网络由于不规则数据分布和空间-时间比例失衡，难以重用现有架构的问题。

Method: 提出了一个统一的事件表示学习框架——OmniEvent，通过解耦增强融合范式来处理事件数据的空间和时间域。

Result: OmniEvent在三个具有代表性的任务和十个数据集上超过任务特定SOTA达68.2%。

Conclusion: OmniEvent能够在多个任务中实现SOTA性能，无需任务特定设计。

Abstract: Event cameras have gained increasing popularity in computer vision due to
their ultra-high dynamic range and temporal resolution. However, event networks
heavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution
and spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing
architectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event
representation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse
tasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous
methods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T
scaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the
local feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial
and temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are
applied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute
efficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to
learn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which
enables standard vision models to process event data without architecture
change. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent
out-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks
and 10 datasets (Fig.1). Code will be ready in

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against computer vision systems have emerged as a
critical research area that challenges the fundamental assumptions about neural
network robustness and security. This comprehensive survey examines the
evolving landscape of adversarial techniques, revealing their dual nature as
both sophisticated security threats and valuable defensive tools. We provide a
systematic analysis of adversarial attack methodologies across three primary
domains: pixel-space attacks, physically realizable attacks, and latent-space
attacks. Our investigation traces the technical evolution from early
gradient-based methods such as FGSM and PGD to sophisticated optimization
techniques incorporating momentum, adaptive step sizes, and advanced
transferability mechanisms. We examine how physically realizable attacks have
successfully bridged the gap between digital vulnerabilities and real-world
threats through adversarial patches, 3D textures, and dynamic optical
perturbations. Additionally, we explore the emergence of latent-space attacks
that leverage semantic structure in internal representations to create more
transferable and meaningful adversarial examples. Beyond traditional offensive
applications, we investigate the constructive use of adversarial techniques for
vulnerability assessment in biometric authentication systems and protection
against malicious generative models. Our analysis reveals critical research
gaps, particularly in neural style transfer protection and computational
efficiency requirements. This survey contributes a comprehensive taxonomy,
evolution analysis, and identification of future research directions, aiming to
advance understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities and inform the development
of more robust and trustworthy computer vision systems.

*Junlong Tong,Wei Zhang,Yaohui Jin,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CGT熵模型通过减少视频冗余的方式优化空间和时间上下文，减少了模型复杂性和计算成本，并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频冗余减少方法中，空间和时间上下文的结合常导致额外的模型复杂性和计算成本增加。同时，很多空间上下文模型没有明确对空间依赖顺序进行建模，这可能限制解码时相关上下文的可用性。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为Context Guided Transformer (CGT)的熵模型，它通过重采样的时间上下文和依赖权重的空间上下文来估计当前帧的概率质量函数。时间上下文重采样器使用transformer编码器来学习预定义的潜在查询，以提取关键时间信息，从而减少下游计算开销。同时，设计了一个教师-学生网络作为依赖权重的空间上下文分配器，以明确建模空间上下文顺序的依赖。

Result: 实验结果表明，CGT模型将熵建模时间减少了约65%，并实现了11%的BD-Rate减少，与现有的最先进的条件熵模型相比。

Conclusion: CGT模型有效减少了熵建模时间并提高了视频压缩性能，解决了现有方法在时间和空间上下文整合上的一些局限性。

Abstract: Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to
reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often
introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In
parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the
ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant
context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided
Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of
the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and
dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns
predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using
transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a
teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context
assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The
teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy
map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the
student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial
dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded
tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that
our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves
an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional
entropy model.

Conclusion: 研究证明，这种基于视线和EEG的数据结合的方法在复杂场景中的应用优于传统方法，提升了目标注视识别的准确性。

Abstract: Distinguishing target from non-target fixations during visual search is a
fundamental building block to understand users' intended actions and to build
effective assistance systems. While prior research indicated the feasibility of
classifying target vs. non-target fixations based on eye tracking and
electroencephalography (EEG) data, these studies were conducted with explicitly
instructed search trajectories, abstract visual stimuli, and disregarded any
scene context. This is in stark contrast with the fact that human visual search
is largely driven by scene characteristics and raises questions regarding
generalizability to more realistic scenarios. To close this gap, we, for the
first time, investigate the classification of target vs. non-target fixations
during free visual search in realistic scenes. In particular, we conducted a
36-participants user study using a large variety of 140 realistic visual search
scenes in two highly relevant application scenarios: searching for icons on
desktop backgrounds and finding tools in a cluttered workshop. Our approach
based on gaze and EEG features outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
approach based on a combination of fixation duration and saccade-related
potentials. We perform extensive evaluations to assess the generalizability of
our approach across scene types. Our approach significantly advances the
ability to distinguish between target and non-target fixations in realistic
scenarios, achieving 83.6% accuracy in cross-user evaluations. This
substantially outperforms previous methods based on saccade-related potentials,
which reached only 56.9% accuracy.

Conclusion: DiffusionFF通过结合扩散模型与伪造检测器的高级特征，显著提高了人脸伪造检测的性能，并提供了更精确的伪造物定位。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation techniques demands robust and
accurate face forgery detection algorithms. While determining whether an image
has been manipulated remains essential, the ability to precisely localize
forgery artifacts has become increasingly important for improving model
explainability and fostering user trust. To address this challenge, we propose
DiffusionFF, a novel framework that enhances face forgery detection through
diffusion-based artifact localization. Our method utilizes a denoising
diffusion model to generate high-quality Structural Dissimilarity (DSSIM) maps,
which effectively capture subtle traces of manipulation. These DSSIM maps are
then fused with high-level semantic features extracted by a pretrained forgery
detector, leading to significant improvements in detection accuracy. Extensive
experiments on both cross-dataset and intra-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffusionFF not only achieves superior detection performance but also offers
precise and fine-grained artifact localization, highlighting its overall
effectiveness.

Result: 广泛的实验表明，我们的方法在流媒体和长视频理解任务上具有优异的响应准确性和实时效率。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在响应准确性和实时效率方面优于现有的方法，突出了其在实际流媒体场景中的实用价值。

Abstract: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving
and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video
processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and
responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However,
existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous
triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits
their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video
streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal
intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant
information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we
integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the
anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align
current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust
the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously
tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a
streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory
structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic
retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional
KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy
and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world
streaming scenarios.

Result: 创建了MIDI数据集，包含538名受试者，605个研究，708系列和53,581个DICOM图像实例，涵盖多个供应商、影像模态和癌症类型。评估框架与HIPAA隐私规则“安全港”方法、DICOM PS3.15机密性配置文件和TCIA最佳实践保持一致。

Conclusion: 开发了一个公开访问的DICOM数据集和评估框架，以便对医学图像的去识别化流程进行基准测试，从而促进更安全和更一致的医学图像共享。

Abstract: Medical imaging research increasingly depends on large-scale data sharing to
promote reproducibility and train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Ensuring
patient privacy remains a significant challenge for open-access data sharing.
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), the global standard
data format for medical imaging, encodes both essential clinical metadata and
extensive protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable
information (PII). Effective de-identification must remove identifiers,
preserve scientific utility, and maintain DICOM validity. Tools exist to
perform de-identification, but few assess its effectiveness, and most rely on
subjective reviews, limiting reproducibility and regulatory confidence. To
address this gap, we developed an openly accessible DICOM dataset infused with
synthetic PHI/PII and an evaluation framework for benchmarking image
de-identification workflows. The Medical Image de-identification (MIDI) dataset
was built using publicly available de-identified data from The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). It includes 538 subjects (216 for validation, 322 for testing),
605 studies, 708 series, and 53,581 DICOM image instances. These span multiple
vendors, imaging modalities, and cancer types. Synthetic PHI and PII were
embedded into structured data elements, plain text data elements, and pixel
data to simulate real-world identity leaks encountered by TCIA curation teams.
Accompanying evaluation tools include a Python script, answer keys (known
truth), and mapping files that enable automated comparison of curated data
against expected transformations. The framework is aligned with the HIPAA
Privacy Rule "Safe Harbor" method, DICOM PS3.15 Confidentiality Profiles, and
TCIA best practices. It supports objective, standards-driven evaluation of
de-identification workflows, promoting safer and more consistent medical image
sharing.

TL;DR: EgoTrigger通过音频触发摄像头，实现智能眼镜的节能，同时增强用户的记忆功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全天候智能眼镜成为持续情境感知的平台，它们在我们的日常生活中扮演着前所未有的辅助角色，需要解决持续感知带来的能源效率挑战。

Method: EgoTrigger利用轻量级音频模型YAMNet和自定义分类头来触发基于手物体互动音频线索的图像捕获，如抽屉打开或药瓶打开的声音。

Result: EgoTrigger平均可以使用少54%的帧，显著节省了包含摄像头在内的耗电部件的能量，同时在数据集上的表现与传统方法相当。

Conclusion: EgoTrigger是一种有效的方法，可以减少能量消耗，同时在记忆增强任务中表现良好。

Abstract: All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous
contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in
our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human
memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a
major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance
requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach,
EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate
power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving
substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight
audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture
from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer
opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the
QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement
Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated
first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure
that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual
understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames
on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components
(e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while
achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We
believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction
for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use
-- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their
keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).

TL;DR: InspectVLM表现不如传统模型，尤其在工业检测中视觉基础弱，语言驱动的统一方法有待改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过统一视觉语言模型（VLMs）简化计算机视觉流程，减少复杂性、低效性和维护负担，特别是在工业检测中。

Method: 使用InspectVLM，一个基于Florence-2的VLM，在InspectMM上进行训练，并在各种任务上评估其表现。

Result: InspectVLM在图像分类和结构化关键点任务上表现出竞争力，但在核心检测指标上不如传统的基于ResNet的模型。并且在提示变化少时表现脆弱，对细粒度对象检测产生退化输出，以及频繁地默认语言记忆响应。

Conclusion: 虽然语言驱动的统一方法在概念上很优雅，但当前的VLMs缺乏视觉基础和稳健性，难以在精确工业检测中应用。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (VLMs) promise to streamline computer vision
pipelines by reframing multiple visual tasks such as classification, detection,
and keypoint localization within a single language-driven interface. This
architecture is particularly appealing in industrial inspection, where managing
disjoint task-specific models introduces complexity, inefficiency, and
maintenance overhead. In this paper, we critically evaluate the viability of
this unified paradigm using InspectVLM, a Florence-2-based VLM trained on
InspectMM, our new large-scale multimodal, multitask inspection dataset. While
InspectVLM performs competitively on image-level classification and structured
keypoint tasks, we find that it fails to match traditional ResNet-based models
in core inspection metrics. Notably, the model exhibits brittle behavior under
low prompt variability, produces degenerate outputs for fine-grained object
detection, and frequently defaults to memorized language responses regardless
of visual input. Our findings suggest that while language-driven unification
offers conceptual elegance, current VLMs lack the visual grounding and
robustness necessary for deployment in precision critical industrial
inspections.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is critical in biomedical imaging to accurately
distinguish individual objects like cells, which often overlap and vary in
size. Recent query-based methods, where object queries guide segmentation, have
shown strong performance. While U-Net has been a go-to architecture in medical
image segmentation, its potential in query-based approaches remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present IAUNet, a novel query-based U-Net
architecture. The core design features a full U-Net architecture, enhanced by a
novel lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder, making the model more efficient
and reducing the number of parameters. Additionally, we propose a Transformer
decoder that refines object-specific features across multiple scales. Finally,
we introduce the 2025 Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset, a unique resource
with detailed annotations of overlapping cell cytoplasm in brightfield images,
setting a new benchmark for biomedical instance segmentation. Experiments on
multiple public datasets and our own show that IAUNet outperforms most
state-of-the-art fully convolutional, transformer-based, and query-based models
and cell segmentation-specific models, setting a strong baseline for cell
instance segmentation tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DBOM的框架，它能有效识别并中和数据集中的后门威胁，提高深度神经网络的训练安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络和生成式AI的广泛应用，它们越来越容易受到后门攻击，这种攻击使得模型对目标标签进行错误分类或误解释。传统攻击通常采用单一触发器，因此需探索防范多重触发器攻击的方法。

Method: 引入DBOM框架，通过结构化解构方法识别和消除数据集级别的已知和未知后门威胁。利用视觉语言模型的预训练编码器，将触发器与对象表示分解为独立成分，采用视觉提示库和提示前缀微调，将提示作为学习过程中的视觉原语，以解构和融合特征以及在共享多模态空间对齐图像特征，实现零样本将看到的和未见到的触发器对象对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，DBOM在CIFAR-10和GTSRB数据集上有效检测受污染的图像，显著提升深度神经网络训练流程的安全性。

Conclusion: DBOM框架通过分离触发器和对象特征并在共享空间对齐图像特征，有效应对多重触发后门攻击，并提升深度神经网络的安全性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to
cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional
single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various
object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade
standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled
Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured
disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor
threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image
representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in
the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By
leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes
the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual
prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships
between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and
object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the
trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling
trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with
feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens
in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel
trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering
deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on
CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior
to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training
pipelines.

To benchmark our method and foster further research, we introduce two newly
collected datasets specifically tailored for multi-altitude camera pose
estimation; datasets of this nature remain rare in the current literature. The
proposed framework has been validated through extensive comparative analyses on
these datasets, demonstrating that our system achieves superior performance in
both accuracy and robustness for multi-altitude sparse pose estimation tasks

Motivation: 为了减少对大规模标记数据集的依赖。

Method: 使用SimCLR框架进行无标签图像预训练，结合对比损失优化。

Result: 实验结果显示SSL预训练可提高mAP，加快收敛速度，改进精度和召回率，尤其在低标签情况下。SimCLR预训练的YOLOv8在mAP@50:95方面超越使用监督预训练的基线。

Conclusion: 对比SSL可作为一种适用于单阶段检测器的有效方法，表明无标签数据在标签高效目标检测中的潜力。

Abstract: One-stage object detectors such as the YOLO family achieve state-of-the-art
performance in real-time vision applications but remain heavily reliant on
large-scale labeled datasets for training. In this work, we present a
systematic study of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) as a means to
reduce this dependency by pretraining YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 backbones on unlabeled
images using the SimCLR framework. Our approach introduces a simple yet
effective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders,
employs global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss
using augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset (120k images). The pretrained
backbones are then fine-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled
data. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently
higher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision-recall performance,
especially in low-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR-pretrained YOLOv8
achieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart
despite using no annotations during pretraining. These findings establish a
strong baseline for applying contrastive SSL to one-stage detectors and
highlight the potential of unlabeled data as a scalable resource for
label-efficient object detection.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆产生的大量数据带来了存储、带宽和处理成本的挑战。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种点云下采样的代表性点选择框架，既保留关键的对象相关信息，又能有效过滤掉不相关的背景点。

Method: 我们的方法包括两个步骤：1. 对象存在检测：引入无监督的基于密度峰值的分类器和监督的朴素贝叶斯分类器来处理不同场景。2. 采样预算分配：提出一种策略选择与对象相关的点，同时保持较高的对象信息保留率。

Abstract: Point clouds are essential for object modeling and play a critical role in
assisting driving tasks for autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the significant
volume of data generated by AVs creates challenges for storage, bandwidth, and
processing cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a representative point
selection framework for point cloud downsampling, which preserves critical
object-related information while effectively filtering out irrelevant
background points. Our method involves two steps: (1) Object Presence
Detection, where we introduce an unsupervised density peak-based classifier and
a supervised Na\"ive Bayes classifier to handle diverse scenarios, and (2)
Sampling Budget Allocation, where we propose a strategy that selects
object-relevant points while maintaining a high retention rate of object
information. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both efficiency and effectiveness across varying sampling rates. As a
model-agnostic solution, our approach integrates seamlessly with diverse
downstream models, making it a valuable and scalable addition to the 3D point
cloud downsampling toolkit for AV applications.

Abstract: Existing human motion Q\&A methods rely on explicit program execution, where
the requirement for manually defined functional modules may limit the
scalability and adaptability. To overcome this, we propose an implicit
program-guided motion reasoning (IMoRe) framework that unifies reasoning across
multiple query types without manually designed modules. Unlike existing
implicit reasoning approaches that infer reasoning operations from question
words, our model directly conditions on structured program functions, ensuring
a more precise execution of reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a
program-guided reading mechanism, which dynamically selects multi-level motion
representations from a pretrained motion Vision Transformer (ViT), capturing
both high-level semantics and fine-grained motion cues. The reasoning module
iteratively refines memory representations, leveraging structured program
functions to extract relevant information for different query types. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Babel-QA and generalizes to a newly
constructed motion Q\&A dataset based on HuMMan, demonstrating its adaptability
across different motion reasoning datasets. Code and dataset are available at:

Abstract: As the application of deep learning in dermatology continues to grow, the
recognition of melanoma has garnered significant attention, demonstrating
potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. Despite advancements in image
classification techniques, existing models still face challenges in identifying
subtle visual cues that differentiate melanoma from benign lesions. This paper
presents a novel Deeply Dual Supervised Learning framework that integrates
local and global feature extraction to enhance melanoma recognition. By
employing a dual-pathway structure, the model focuses on both fine-grained
local features and broader contextual information, ensuring a comprehensive
understanding of the image content. The framework utilizes a dual attention
mechanism that dynamically emphasizes critical features, thereby reducing the
risk of overlooking subtle characteristics of melanoma. Additionally, we
introduce a multi-scale feature aggregation strategy to ensure robust
performance across varying image resolutions. Extensive experiments on

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging seeks to reconstruct hidden objects by
analyzing reflections from intermediary surfaces. Existing methods typically
model both the measurement data and the hidden scene in three dimensions,
overlooking the inherently two-dimensional nature of most hidden objects. This
oversight leads to high computational costs and substantial memory consumption,
limiting practical applications and making real-time, high-resolution NLOS
imaging on lightweight devices challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach that represents the hidden scene using two-dimensional functions and
employs a Quasi-Fresnel transform to establish a direct inversion formula
between the measurement data and the hidden scene. This transformation
leverages the two-dimensional characteristics of the problem to significantly
reduce computational complexity and memory requirements. Our algorithm
efficiently performs fast transformations between these two-dimensional
aggregated data, enabling rapid reconstruction of hidden objects with minimal
memory usage. Compared to existing methods, our approach reduces runtime and
memory demands by several orders of magnitude while maintaining imaging
quality. The substantial reduction in memory usage not only enhances
computational efficiency but also enables NLOS imaging on lightweight devices
such as mobile and embedded systems. We anticipate that this method will
facilitate real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging and broaden its
applicability across a wider range of platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像条件生成方法不能很好地反映用户的意图，特别是在细节上，如纹理，这在很大程度上是因为自注意力机制的限制。为了提高生成图像对图像提示的细节反映，需要改进自注意力的方法。

Method: 本文提出了无冲突引导和分层注意力两种方法。无冲突引导只将图像提示作为期望条件，从而避免了在无分类器指导下的冲突信号。分层注意力通过同时使用两幅图像的键和值来实现对比度和真实感的平衡，而不是在它们之间进行选择。

Result: 经过在三个图像生成任务中的广泛实验，提出的方法能够优于现有的图像提示生成模型，更好地反映图像提示的细节。

Conclusion: 本文通过修改自注意力机制，提出了一种无冲突引导和分层注意力的方法，解决了基于图像提示进行图像生成时的常见问题，并提高了生成结果的真实感和与提示的对齐度。

Abstract: While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models enable the generation of
high-quality, diverse images from text prompts, these prompts struggle to
capture intricate details, such as textures, preventing the user intent from
being reflected. This limitation has led to efforts to generate images
conditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work
modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated
images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.
This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,
generally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two
common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate
images that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches
neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.
Specifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired
conditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve
this, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired
conditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image
prompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention
modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image
and alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and
values from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the
generated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new
self-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys
and values from both images rather than selecting between them. Through
extensive experiments across three image generation tasks, we show that the
proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully
reflecting the image prompt.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols
for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop
settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative
closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience,
and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified
hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive
assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by
dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation
environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design,
heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast
system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into
standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To
bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control
abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level
actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs
on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM
introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically
explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for
safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a
hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract
reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution.
Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and
physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing
that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop
conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着面部识别技术的广泛应用，人们面临严重的隐私问题，尤其是通过大规模图像检索系统对个人身份及数字足迹的曝光。

Method: 提出了一种名为Protego的用户中心隐私保护方法，将用户的3D面部特征转化为动态变形的自然2D代表，进行线上共享前的保护。

Result: 实验表明，Protego显著降低了各种黑箱FR模型的检索准确性，其性能至少比现有方法提高两倍。同时在视频场景中提供了前所未有的视觉一致性。

Conclusion: Protego在打击面部识别滥用和未经允许的身份追踪方面具有重要贡献。

Abstract: Face recognition (FR) technologies are increasingly used to power large-scale
image retrieval systems, raising serious privacy concerns. Services like
Clearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a
large amount of online content associated with that person. This not only
enables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as
social media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their
consent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a
user-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such
retrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial
signatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically
deformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of
any facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing. Motivated by
a critical limitation of existing methods, Protego amplifies the sensitivity of
FR models so that protected images cannot be matched even among themselves.
Experiments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across a
wide range of black-box FR models and performs at least 2x better than existing
methods. It also offers unprecedented visual coherence, particularly in video
settings where consistency and natural appearance are essential. Overall,
Protego contributes to the fight against the misuse of FR for mass surveillance
and unsolicited identity tracing.

TL;DR: ADDiff-Dose通过条件扩散模型实现多肿瘤剂量预测，显著提高了预测精度和临床兼容性，降低了规划时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在推广性、预测准确度及临床应用上存在局限性，放射治疗规划需要耗时的反复调整并依赖专家经验，亟需更高效的自动化解决方案。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为ADDiff-Dose的条件扩散模型，利用轻量级3D变分自编码器压缩高维CT数据，结合多种输入模式，通过多头注意机制和复合损失函数实现剂量预测。

Result: 在大规模公共数据集和三个外部机构队列测试中，ADDiff-Dose实现了0.101-0.154的MAE，DICE系数0.927，显著优于传统基线；每例的平均规划生成时间缩减至22秒。

Conclusion: ADDiff-Dose首次应用条件扩散模型解决放射治疗剂量预测问题，提供了一个高效的自动化治疗规划新方案，显著降低了规划时间并提高了临床工作流程效率。

Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning often relies on time-consuming,
trial-and-error adjustments that heavily depend on the expertise of
specialists, while existing deep learning methods face limitations in
generalization, prediction accuracy, and clinical applicability. To tackle
these challenges, we propose ADDiff-Dose, an Anatomical-Dose Dual Constraints
Conditional Diffusion Model for end-to-end multi-tumor dose prediction. The
model employs LightweightVAE3D to compress high-dimensional CT data and
integrates multimodal inputs, including target and organ-at-risk (OAR) masks
and beam parameters, within a progressive noise addition and denoising
framework. It incorporates conditional features via a multi-head attention
mechanism and utilizes a composite loss function combining MSE, conditional
terms, and KL divergence to ensure both dosimetric accuracy and compliance with
clinical constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale public dataset (2,877 cases)
and three external institutional cohorts (450 cases in total) demonstrates that
ADDiff-Dose significantly outperforms traditional baselines, achieving an MAE
of 0.101-0.154 (compared to 0.316 for UNet and 0.169 for GAN models), a DICE
coefficient of 0.927 (a 6.8% improvement), and limiting spinal cord maximum
dose error to within 0.1 Gy. The average plan generation time per case is
reduced to 22 seconds. Ablation studies confirm that the structural encoder
enhances compliance with clinical dose constraints by 28.5%. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to introduce a conditional diffusion model framework
for radiotherapy dose prediction, offering a generalizable and efficient
solution for automated treatment planning across diverse tumor sites, with the
potential to substantially reduce planning time and improve clinical workflow
efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提供了一个新的交通标志验证集MVV，并证明DINOv2模型在交通标志识别中优于现有视觉语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶数据集经常缺乏精细化的交通标志注释，不能区分停止标志或速度限制标志等语义重要类别，影响自动驾驶决策的准确性和安全性。

Method: 提供一个新的验证集Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs (MVV)，将复杂的交通标志分解为语义上有意义的类别，并手动进行像素级别的实例标记。使用自监督模型DINOv2与现有视觉语言模型进行性能对比。

Result: DINOv2模型在识别交通标志及在汽车和人类等类别的表现优于所有视觉语言模型基准。

Conclusion: 现有视觉语言模型存在重大局限性，DINOv2可以作为自动驾驶语境中的密集语义匹配的强基准，为更可靠、可解释、可扩展的感知系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality fine-grained annotations for traffic signs is critical
for accurate and safe decision-making in autonomous driving. Widely used
datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without
distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit
signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived
from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs
(MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically
meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has
been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further,
we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2
model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM
baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented
categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant
limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual
understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic
matching in autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset and evaluation framework
pave the way for more reliable, interpretable, and scalable perception systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的图像压缩框架，可提高压缩效率和质量，在多个数据集上展示了显著的性能优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在计算资源利用和压缩效率方面存在不足，难以满足不同节点和阶段间变化的质量需求。

Method: 基于HCF，引入了策略驱动的量化控制来优化率失真平衡，并通过微分熵分析建立边缘量化原则。

Result: HCF在Kodak、CLIC和CLIC2020-mobile数据集上进行了全面评估，展示了显著的性能提升。例如，与连续压缩方法相比，PSNR上的BD-Rate减少了最多达5.56%，同时节省了最多97.8%的FLOPs，96.5%的GPU内存，以及90%的执行时间。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种分布式多阶段图像压缩系统的分层级联框架（HCF），能够通过直接的潜在空间转换实现高效的率失真性能。

Abstract: Distributed multi-stage image compression -- where visual content traverses
multiple processing nodes under varying quality requirements -- poses
challenges. Progressive methods enable bitstream truncation but underutilize
available compute resources; successive compression repeats costly pixel-domain
operations and suffers cumulative quality loss and inefficiency;
fixed-parameter models lack post-encoding flexibility. In this work, we
developed the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) that achieves high
rate-distortion performance and better computational efficiency through direct
latent-space transformations across network nodes in distributed multi-stage
image compression system. Under HCF, we introduced policy-driven quantization
control to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs, and established the edge
quantization principle through differential entropy analysis. The configuration
based on this principle demonstrates up to 0.6dB PSNR gains over other
configurations. When comprehensively evaluated on the Kodak, CLIC, and
CLIC2020-mobile datasets, HCF outperforms successive-compression methods by up
to 5.56% BD-Rate in PSNR on CLIC, while saving up to 97.8% FLOPs, 96.5% GPU
memory, and 90.0% execution time. It also outperforms state-of-the-art
progressive compression methods by up to 12.64% BD-Rate on Kodak and enables
retraining-free cross-quality adaptation with 7.13-10.87% BD-Rate reductions on
CLIC2020-mobile.

TL;DR: StarPose是一种新的自回归扩散框架，通过结合历史3D姿势和空间-时间物理指导改进姿势预测的准确性和时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer或CNN的单目3D人体姿势估计方法存在深度歧义和遮挡问题，而最新的扩散方法虽然性能较优但缺乏对空间和时间的相关性考虑，从而影响预测的时间一致性和准确性。

Method: 本文提出了一种自回归扩散框架StarPose，将3D姿势映射为自回归扩散过程，通过历史姿势整合模块生成丰富的历史姿势嵌入，同时采用空间-时间物理指导机制迭代优化降噪过程。

Result: StarPose在基准数据集上实现了优于最新方法的表现，具有更高的准确性和时间一致性。

Conclusion: StarPose通过历史3D姿势预测和空间-时间物理指导显著提高了3D姿势预测的准确性和时间一致性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent
depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on
Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based
approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic
nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often
fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted
frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in
predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes
StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates
historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to
significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose
predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose
mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating
previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose
Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative
historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring
temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play
Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the
denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial
anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and
realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation. Code is

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的结构化放射学报告生成方法，创建了一个新的数据集，并引入了专门的评价指标以评估报告质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的自由文本报告存在冗余和语言不一致的问题，导致关键临床细节的提取变得复杂。结构化放射学报告生成（S-RRG）通过将信息组织成标准化、简明格式，提供了一种解决方案。然而，现有方法常常依赖需要预定义标签集的分类或视觉问答（VQA）流程，且仅产生片段化的输出。基于模板的方法通过替换固定句子模式中的关键字生成报告，进一步削弱了表达能力，并常常忽略临床重要细节。

Method: 本文提出了一种包含数据集构建、模型训练和新的评估框架引入的结构化放射学报告生成（S-RRG）新方法。首先创建一个包含疾病名称、严重程度、概率和解剖位置的胸部X射线数据集（MIMIC-STRUC），确保其临床相关性和结构良好。然后训练一个基于LLM的模型以生成标准化、高质量的报告。为评估生成的报告，我们提出了一种专门的评价指标（S-Score），它不仅衡量疾病预测的准确性，还评估疾病特定细节的精确性。

Result: 提出的S-RRG方法通过生成结构化报告来展示其效果，并强调专门评估指标对于S-RRG的重要性，提供一个更具临床相关性的报告质量度量。

Conclusion: 我们的研究展示了结构化报告的有效性以及量身定制的评估指标在S-RRG中的重要性，为报告质量提供了一个更具临床意义的度量标准。

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) for diagnostic images, such as chest
X-rays, plays a pivotal role in both clinical practice and AI. Traditional
free-text reports suffer from redundancy and inconsistent language,
complicating the extraction of critical clinical details. Structured radiology
report generation (S-RRG) offers a promising solution by organizing information
into standardized, concise formats. However, existing approaches often rely on
classification or visual question answering (VQA) pipelines that require
predefined label sets and produce only fragmented outputs. Template-based
approaches, which generate reports by replacing keywords within fixed sentence
patterns, further compromise expressiveness and often omit clinically important
details. In this work, we present a novel approach to S-RRG that includes
dataset construction, model training, and the introduction of a new evaluation
framework. We first create a robust chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC) that
includes disease names, severity levels, probabilities, and anatomical
locations, ensuring that the dataset is both clinically relevant and
well-structured. We train an LLM-based model to generate standardized,
high-quality reports. To assess the generated reports, we propose a specialized
evaluation metric (S-Score) that not only measures disease prediction accuracy
but also evaluates the precision of disease-specific details, thus offering a
clinically meaningful metric for report quality that focuses on elements
critical to clinical decision-making and demonstrates a stronger alignment with
human assessments. Our approach highlights the effectiveness of structured
reports and the importance of a tailored evaluation metric for S-RRG, providing
a more clinically relevant measure of report quality.

Motivation: 当前的视觉语言模型（VLMs）在动态时空交互理解方面存在局限性。

Method: 引入VLM4D基准，通过评估VLMs的时空推理能力，分析现有模型的性能差距。

Result: VLMs在整合多种视觉线索和维持时间连续性方面表现不佳，但通过4D特征场重构和针对性时空监督微调，时空理解能力得到了提升。

Conclusion: 研究指出现有VLMs在动态环境中的视觉智能能力不足，倡导深入探索以改进其时空基础。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
integrating linguistic and visual reasoning but remain fundamentally limited in
understanding dynamic spatiotemporal interactions. Humans effortlessly track
and reason about object movements, rotations, and perspective shifts-abilities
essential for robust dynamic real-world understanding yet notably lacking in
current VLMs. In this paper, we introduce VLM4D, the first benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities of
VLMs. Our benchmark comprises diverse real-world and synthetic videos
accompanied by carefully curated question-answer pairs emphasizing
translational and rotational motions, perspective awareness, and motion
continuity. Through comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open and
closed-source VLMs, we identify significant performance gaps compared to human
baselines, highlighting fundamental deficiencies in existing models. Extensive
analysis reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with integrating multiple
visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence. We further explore promising
directions, such as leveraging 4D feature field reconstruction and targeted
spatiotemporal supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating their effectiveness in
enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension. Our work aims to encourage deeper
exploration into improving VLMs' spatial and temporal grounding, paving the way
towards more capable and reliable visual intelligence for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Real-time synthesis of physically plausible human interactions remains a
critical challenge for immersive VR/AR systems and humanoid robotics. While
existing methods demonstrate progress in kinematic motion generation, they
often fail to address the fundamental tension between real-time responsiveness,
physical feasibility, and safety requirements in dynamic human-machine
interactions. We introduce Human-X, a novel framework designed to enable
immersive and physically plausible human interactions across diverse entities,
including human-avatar, human-humanoid, and human-robot systems. Unlike
existing approaches that focus on post-hoc alignment or simplified physics, our
method jointly predicts actions and reactions in real-time using an
auto-regressive reaction diffusion planner, ensuring seamless synchronization
and context-aware responses. To enhance physical realism and safety, we
integrate an actor-aware motion tracking policy trained with reinforcement
learning, which dynamically adapts to interaction partners' movements while
avoiding artifacts like foot sliding and penetration. Extensive experiments on
the Inter-X and InterHuman datasets demonstrate significant improvements in
motion quality, interaction continuity, and physical plausibility over
state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is validated in real-world
applications, including virtual reality interface for human-robot interaction,
showcasing its potential for advancing human-robot collaboration.

Conclusion: 我们的新框架成功解决了分布式开放源代码LoRA模块的挑战，通过建立标准化的适配器集成，促进了模型的协作演化。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in photorealistic image generation through
large-scale models like FLUX and Stable Diffusion v3, the practical deployment
of these architectures remains constrained by their inherent intractability to
parameter fine-tuning. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have demonstrated
efficacy in enabling model customization with minimal parameter overhead, the
effective utilization of distributed open-source LoRA modules faces three
critical challenges: sparse metadata annotation, the requirement for zero-shot
adaptation capabilities, and suboptimal fusion strategies for multi-LoRA fusion
strategies. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that
enables semantic-driven LoRA retrieval and dynamic aggregation through two key
components: (1) weight encoding-base LoRA retriever that establishes a shared
semantic space between LoRA parameter matrices and text prompts, eliminating
dependence on original training data, and (2) fine-grained gated fusion
mechanism that computes context-specific fusion weights across network layers
and diffusion timesteps to optimally integrate multiple LoRA modules during
generation. Our approach achieves significant improvement in image generation
perfermance, thereby facilitating scalable and data-efficient enhancement of
foundational models. This work establishes a critical bridge between the
fragmented landscape of community-developed LoRAs and practical deployment
requirements, enabling collaborative model evolution through standardized
adapter integration.

Conclusion: 该研究成功设计算法DeflareMamba，通过利用状态空间模型的序列建模能力有效去除反射和散射的光晕伪影，并保持非光晕区域的自然外观。实验表明，该方法提高了视觉对象识别和跨模态语义理解能力。

Abstract: Lens flare removal remains an information confusion challenge in the
underlying image background and the optical flares, due to the complex optical
interactions between light sources and camera lens. While recent solutions have
shown promise in decoupling the flare corruption from image, they often fail to
maintain contextual consistency, leading to incomplete and inconsistent flare
removal. To eliminate this limitation, we propose DeflareMamba, which leverages
the efficient sequence modeling capabilities of state space models while
maintains the ability to capture local-global dependencies. Particularly, we
design a hierarchical framework that establishes long-range pixel correlations
through varied stride sampling patterns, and utilize local-enhanced state space
models that simultaneously preserves local details. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that introduces state space models to the
flare removal task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively removes various types of flare artifacts, including scattering and
reflective flares, while maintaining the natural appearance of non-flare
regions. Further downstream applications demonstrate the capacity of our method
to improve visual object recognition and cross-modal semantic understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在不使用额外传感器的情况下，如何在恶劣光照条件下准确地检测目标，尤其是减少因墙壁或路面反射引发的误检测。

Method: NRE-Net框架融合了从单目RGB图像预测的表面法线图、RGB图像和事件流，采用自适应双流融合模块（ADFM）和事件模态感知融合模块（EAFM）来优化融合过程。

Result: 相比于基于帧的方法（如YOLOX），在DSEC-Det-sub和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上分别提高了7.9%和6.1%的mAP50，同时在DSEC-Det-sub数据集上超越了融合方法SFNet 2.7%，在PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上超越了SODFormer 7.1%。

Conclusion: NRE-Net在挑战性光照条件下显著提高了目标检测的准确性，其性能优于当前最先进的方法。

Abstract: Accurate object detection under adverse lighting conditions is critical for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Although neuromorphic event
cameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often
induces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which
frequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event
data alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these
issues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these
challenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from
monocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and
enhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection
framework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly
predicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the
fusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive
Dual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features,
and the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high
dynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the
DSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves mAP50 improvements
of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based approaches (e.g., YOLOX), while surpassing
the fusion-based SFNet by 2.7% on the DSEC-Det-sub dataset and SODFormer by
7.1% on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD dataset.

Conclusion: 我们的框架显著增强了动态建模能力，尤其在快速移动物体的合成中，相比基线方法在PSNR上提高了约2 dB。

Abstract: Dynamic urban scene modeling is a rapidly evolving area with broad
applications. While current approaches leveraging neural radiance fields or
Gaussian Splatting have achieved fine-grained reconstruction and high-fidelity
novel view synthesis, they still face significant limitations. These often stem
from a dependence on pre-calibrated object tracks or difficulties in accurately
modeling fast-moving objects from undersampled capture, particularly due to
challenges in handling temporal discontinuities. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our
key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time
adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective
integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a
joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses,
and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content
while preserving well-reconstructed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances dynamic modeling, especially for
fast-moving objects, achieving an approximate PSNR gain of 2 dB for novel view
synthesis over baseline approaches.

*Behnaz Kavoosighafi,Rafal K. Mantiuk,Saghi Hajisharif,Ehsan Miandji,Jonas Unger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经网络的BRDF质量度量方法，能够更好地反映人类感知差异，尽管其在BRDF拟合中表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的BRDF空间度量常用于评估双向反射分布函数模型的质量，但这些度量方法通常依赖于数值误差，无法捕捉渲染图像中的感知差异。因此，引入一种感知信息驱动的质量度量是必要的。

Method: 该论文提出了一种感知信息驱动的神经网络质量度量方法，直接在BRDF空间操作。具体而言，作者构建了一个多层感知机（MLP），通过具有感知验证的图像空间度量标记的数据库进行训练，从而评估参考和近似BRDF样本的感知质量。

Result: 神经网络度量在与人类判断的相关性方面显著优于现有的BRDF空间度量。然而，该度量作为BRDF拟合的损失函数，其性能仍然有限。

Conclusion: 尽管作为损失函数的表现有限，但所提出的神经网络度量提供了一种基于感知的信息进行BRDF模型评估的方法。

Abstract: Accurately evaluating the quality of bidirectional reflectance distribution
function (BRDF) models is essential for photo-realistic rendering. Traditional
BRDF-space metrics often employ numerical error measures that fail to capture
perceptual differences evident in rendered images. In this paper, we introduce
the first perceptually informed neural quality metric for BRDF evaluation that
operates directly in BRDF space, eliminating the need for rendering during
quality assessment. Our metric is implemented as a compact multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), trained on a dataset of measured BRDFs supplemented with
synthetically generated data and labelled using a perceptually validated
image-space metric. The network takes as input paired samples of reference and
approximated BRDFs and predicts their perceptual quality in terms of
just-objectionable-difference (JOD) scores. We show that our neural metric
achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgments than existing
BRDF-space metrics. While its performance as a loss function for BRDF fitting
remains limited, the proposed metric offers a perceptually grounded alternative
for evaluating BRDF models.

*Kuo Wang,Quanlong Zheng,Junlin Xie,Yanhao Zhang,Jinguo Luo,Haonan Lu,Liang Lin,Fan Zhou,Guanbin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Free-MoRef是一种训练自由的方法，通过重构视觉令牌并进行多参考融合来提高长视频输入的理解能力，实验表明该方法在性能和效率上优于现有解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Video-MLLM在处理长视频场景时性能表现欠佳，需一种在不牺牲特征粒度或推理效率的情况下，能高效理解长视频输入的方法。

Method: Free-MoRef通过重构视觉令牌为多个短序列，即多参考，之后利用MoRef-attention并行收集多参考块中的信息来汇总统一的查询激活，并在LLMs的阴影层之后进行参考融合。

Result: 在VideoMME、MLVU和LongVideoBench上的实验表明，Free-MoRef能够在不进行压缩的情况下完整感知2倍至8倍更长的输入帧，同时保持快速响应，在单个A100 GPU上实现显著性能提升。

Conclusion: Free-MoRef能够在保持计算效率的情况下显著提升长视频输入的性能，甚至超越专门训练的长视频-MLLMs。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models~(Video-MLLM) have achieved remarkable
advancements in video understanding tasks. However, constrained by the context
length limitation in the underlying LLMs, existing Video-MLLMs typically
exhibit suboptimal performance on long video scenarios. To understand extended
input frames, common solutions span token compression and streaming inference
techniques, which sacrifice feature granularity or inference efficiency.
Differently, to efficiently achieve comprehensive understanding of longer frame
inputs, we draw ideas from MoE and propose a training-free approach
\textbf{Free-MoRef}, which instantly multiplexes the context perception
capabilities of Video-MLLMs within one inference pass. Specifically, Free-MoRef
reconstructs the vision tokens into several short sequences as
multi-references. Subsequently, we introduce MoRef-attention, which gathers
clues from the multi-reference chunks in parallel to summarize unified query
activations. After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is
derived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from
parallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that
are neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token
sequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing
costs in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency
and effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that
Free-MoRef achieves full perception of 2$\times$ to 8$\times$ longer input
frames without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant
responses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing
dedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at

TL;DR: AID4AD数据集结合航拍图像与nuScenes数据集，提高自动驾驶车辆感知任务精度，特别是在高精度地图不可用的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整合航拍图像以改进自动驾驶车辆的地图构建和运动预测性能，尤其是在高精度地图不可用或成本高的情况下。

Method: 使用SLAM点云地图进行空间对齐，通过手动质量控制流程校正定位和投影失真，确保数据集的空间保真度。在地图构建和运动预测任务中展示其实用价值。

Result: 航拍图像使得地图构建精度提高15-23%，轨迹预测性能提升2%。

Conclusion: AID4AD数据集结合高分辨率航拍图像与nuScenes数据集，提高自动车辆感知任务的精度和功能。航拍图像作为可扩展的环境上下文来源，对高精度地图不可用、过时或维护成本高的场景尤其有潜力。

Abstract: This work investigates the integration of spatially aligned aerial imagery
into perception tasks for automated vehicles (AVs). As a central contribution,
we present AID4AD, a publicly available dataset that augments the nuScenes
dataset with high-resolution aerial imagery precisely aligned to its local
coordinate system. The alignment is performed using SLAM-based point cloud maps
provided by nuScenes, establishing a direct link between aerial data and
nuScenes local coordinate system. To ensure spatial fidelity, we propose an
alignment workflow that corrects for localization and projection distortions. A
manual quality control process further refines the dataset by identifying a set
of high-quality alignments, which we publish as ground truth to support future
research on automated registration. We demonstrate the practical value of
AID4AD in two representative tasks: in online map construction, aerial imagery
serves as a complementary input that improves the mapping process; in motion
prediction, it functions as a structured environmental representation that
replaces high-definition maps. Experiments show that aerial imagery leads to a
15-23% improvement in map construction accuracy and a 2% gain in trajectory
prediction performance. These results highlight the potential of aerial imagery
as a scalable and adaptable source of environmental context in automated
vehicle systems, particularly in scenarios where high-definition maps are
unavailable, outdated, or costly to maintain. AID4AD, along with evaluation
code and pretrained models, is publicly released to foster further research in
this direction: https://github.com/DriverlessMobility/AID4AD.

Motivation: 当前深度学习驱动的步态识别技术在复杂的真实环境下仍存在挑战，传统方法在非周期且遮挡的外形序列中效果不佳。

Method: 提出了随机轨迹采样方法、基于Haar小波的降采样技术和困难排除三元组损失函数。

Result: TrackletGait在Gait3D和GREW数据集上分别达到了77.8和80.4的rank-1准确率，同时模型参数量仅为10.3M。

Conclusion: TrackletGait框架在真实复杂环境中实现了先进的步态识别效果，展示出优异的准确率，同时显著降低了模型参数量。

Abstract: Gait recognition aims to identify individuals based on their body shape and
walking patterns. Though much progress has been achieved driven by deep
learning, gait recognition in real-world surveillance scenarios remains quite
challenging to current methods. Conventional approaches, which rely on periodic
gait cycles and controlled environments, struggle with the non-periodic and
occluded silhouette sequences encountered in the wild. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, TrackletGait, designed to address these challenges
in the wild. We propose Random Tracklet Sampling, a generalization of existing
sampling methods, which strikes a balance between robustness and representation
in capturing diverse walking patterns. Next, we introduce Haar Wavelet-based
Downsampling to preserve information during spatial downsampling. Finally, we
present a Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss, designed to exclude low-quality
silhouettes by discarding hard triplet samples. TrackletGait achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 77.8 and 80.4 rank-1 accuracy on the Gait3D and
GREW datasets, respectively, while using only 10.3M backbone parameters.
Extensive experiments are also conducted to further investigate the factors
affecting gait recognition in the wild.

*Ziyang Luo,Nian Liu,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Junwei Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AURORA通过增强推理和语言理解能力，提高了参考音视分割任务的性能，并设计了一系列机制保持分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏真正的语义理解，往往会记住固定的推理模式，而联合训练推理和分割可能会影响像素级的精度。为解决这些问题，引入了AURORA框架。

Method: 采用结构化的链式思维提示机制引导模型进行逐步推理，并引入新的分割特征蒸馏损失。同时设计了两阶段训练策略，包括更正反思式训练和通过群组奖励策略优化进行强化学习。

Result: AURORA在Ref-AVS基准上达到最先进的性能，并能有效泛化到无参考分割。

Conclusion: AURORA框架提升了参考音视分割（Ref-AVS）的性能，通过增强模型的推理和语言理解能力，同时保持分割精度。

Abstract: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) tasks challenge models to
precisely locate sounding objects by integrating visual, auditory, and textual
cues. Existing methods often lack genuine semantic understanding, tending to
memorize fixed reasoning patterns. Furthermore, jointly training for reasoning
and segmentation can compromise pixel-level precision. To address these issues,
we introduce AURORA, a novel framework designed to enhance genuine reasoning
and language comprehension in reference audio-visual segmentation. We employ a
structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mechanism to guide the model
through a step-by-step reasoning process and introduce a novel segmentation
feature distillation loss to effectively integrate these reasoning abilities
without sacrificing segmentation performance. To further cultivate the model's
genuine reasoning capabilities, we devise a further two-stage training
strategy: first, a ``corrective reflective-style training" stage utilizes
self-correction to enhance the quality of reasoning paths, followed by
reinforcement learning via Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to bolster
robustness in challenging scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that AURORA
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ref-AVS benchmarks and generalizes
effectively to unreferenced segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttriCtrl是一种新框架，提供美学属性的精确和连续控制，解决了文本生成图像模型中细粒度控制的挑战，并与现有开源框架兼容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本生成图像扩散模型在视觉真实感和语义可控性取得进展，但在美学属性的细粒度控制方面仍面临挑战，尤其是要求持续和特定强度的调整。现有方法依赖模糊文本提示或昂贵的人类偏好数据，限制了其可扩展性和实用性。

Conclusion: AttriCtrl框架成功提供了精确和连续的美学属性控制，增强了开放源代码生成框架的集成能力和实用性。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly
enhanced both the visual fidelity and semantic controllability of generated
images. However, fine-grained control over aesthetic attributes remains
challenging, especially when users require continuous and intensity-specific
adjustments. Existing approaches often rely on vague textual prompts, which are
inherently ambiguous in expressing both the aesthetic semantics and the desired
intensity, or depend on costly human preference data for alignment, limiting
their scalability and practicality. To address these limitations, we propose
AttriCtrl, a plug-and-play framework for precise and continuous control of
aesthetic attributes. Specifically, we quantify abstract aesthetics by
leveraging semantic similarity from pre-trained vision-language models, and
employ a lightweight value encoder that maps scalar intensities in $[0,1]$ to
learnable embeddings within diffusion-based generation. This design enables
intuitive and customizable aesthetic manipulation, with minimal training
overhead and seamless integration into existing generation pipelines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AttriCtrl achieves accurate control over
individual attributes as well as flexible multi-attribute composition.
Moreover, it is fully compatible with popular open-source controllable
generation frameworks, showcasing strong integration capability and practical
utility across diverse generation scenarios.

Conclusion: 实验表明，所提的算法在无噪图像上与最新的ADMM方法效果相当，但在去除高斯噪声方面表现更佳。

Abstract: Recently convolutional sparse representation (CSR), as a sparse
representation technique, has attracted increasing attention in the field of
image processing, due to its good characteristic of translate-invariance. The
content of CSR usually consists of convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and
convolutional dictionary learning (CDL), and many studies focus on how to solve
the corresponding optimization problems. At present, the most efficient
optimization scheme for CSC is based on the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). However, the ADMM-based approach involves a penalty
parameter that needs to be carefully selected, and improper parameter selection
may result in either no convergence or very slow convergence. In this paper, a
novel fast and efficient method using Chambolle-Pock(CP) framework is proposed,
which does not require extra manual selection parameters in solving processing,
and has faster convergence speed. Furthermore, we propose an anisotropic total
variation penalty of the coefficient maps for CSC and apply the CP algorithm to
solve it. In addition, we also apply the CP framework to solve the
corresponding CDL problem. Experiments show that for noise-free image the
proposed CSC algorithms can achieve rival results of the latest ADMM-based
approach, while outperforms in removing noise from Gaussian noise pollution
image.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于扩散的图像生成已被广泛探索和应用，但电商场景中的背景生成任务仍面临重大挑战。

Method: 我们提出了DreamPainter，一个新颖的框架，不仅使用文本提示进行控制，还灵活地结合参考图像信息作为额外的控制信号。

Result: 我们的方法在保持高产品一致性,并有效地整合文本提示和参考图像信息方面，显著超过了最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 我们的方法显著优于现有的最先进的方法，可以在保持高产品一致性的同时，有效地整合文本提示和参考图像信息。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based image genenation has been widely explored and
applied, background generation tasks in e-commerce scenarios still face
significant challenges. The first challenge is to ensure that the generated
products are consistent with the given product inputs while maintaining a
reasonable spatial arrangement, harmonious shadows, and reflections between
foreground products and backgrounds. Existing inpainting methods fail to
address this due to the lack of domain-specific data. The second challenge
involves the limitation of relying solely on text prompts for image control, as
effective integrating visual information to achieve precise control in
inpainting tasks remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamEcom-400K, a high-quality e-commerce dataset containing accurate
product instance masks, background reference images, text prompts, and
aesthetically pleasing product images. Based on this dataset, we propose
DreamPainter, a novel framework that not only utilizes text prompts for control
but also flexibly incorporates reference image information as an additional
control signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, maintaining high product
consistency while effectively integrating both text prompt and reference image
information.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种在RGB图像上进行统一目标检测和姿态估计的新方法，表现优于现有技术，具有更强的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法使用RGB-D输入或分为两阶段方法，这可能不总是实用，通过创建一个集成模型来解决这一问题。

Method: 在RGB图像上利用神经网络网格模型和多模型RANSAC进行特征学习，形成一个统一的检测和姿态估计框架。

Result: 在REAL275数据集上，该方法在所有尺度无关指标上平均提高了22.9%，实现了RGB分类级姿态估计的最先进表现。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的统一模型，将目标检测与姿态估计集成到RGB图像的单一框架中，取得了优越的性能，表现出较强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recognizing objects in images is a fundamental problem in computer vision.
Although detecting objects in 2D images is common, many applications require
determining their pose in 3D space. Traditional category-level methods rely on
RGB-D inputs, which may not always be available, or employ two-stage approaches
that use separate models and representations for detection and pose estimation.
For the first time, we introduce a unified model that integrates detection and
pose estimation into a single framework for RGB images by leveraging neural
mesh models with learned features and multi-model RANSAC. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results for RGB category-level pose estimation on REAL275,
improving on the current state-of-the-art by 22.9% averaged across all
scale-agnostic metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our unified method
exhibits greater robustness compared to single-stage baselines. Our code and
models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在生成任务中难以平衡原始主题和风格，需要额外的训练。虽然K-LoRA提供了一种无训练的LoRA融合方法，但包含多个超参数，难以适应所有风格和主题。

Method: 提出了一种无训练的自适应LoRA融合方法EST-LoRA，它综合考虑了矩阵的能量、风格差异评分和时间步三个关键因素。模型在每个注意层内自适应地选择主题LoRA和风格LoRA，确保生成过程中两者的平衡贡献。

Result: 实验结果表明，EST-LoRA在定性和定量评估中都优于最先进的方法，并且生成速度比其他高效融合方法更快。

Conclusion: EST-LoRA能在生成任务中有效融合原始主题和风格，且无需额外训练，表现优于现有的方法。

Abstract: Fine-tuning models via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) demonstrates remarkable
performance in subject-driven or style-driven generation tasks. Studies have
explored combinations of different LoRAs to jointly generate learned styles and
content. However, current methods struggle to balance the original subject and
style, and often require additional training. Recently, K-LoRA proposed a
training-free LoRA fusion method. But it involves multiple hyperparameters,
making it difficult to adapt to all styles and subjects. In this paper, we
propose EST-LoRA, a training-free adaptive LoRA fusion method. It
comprehensively considers three critical factors: \underline{E}nergy of matrix,
\underline{S}tyle discrepancy scores and \underline{T}ime steps. Analogous to
the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, the model adaptively selects between
subject LoRA and style LoRA within each attention layer. This integrated
selection mechanism ensures balanced contributions from both components during
the generation process. Experimental results show that EST-LoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and
achieves faster generation speed compared to other efficient fusion approaches.

Motivation: 现有方法往往对于多种复杂光源场景简化处理，导致多种视觉伪影，因此需要新的方法来更好地分离照明与反射。

Method: 采用一种新的学习框架，结合显式色度和亮度成分指导，灵感来源于Retinex模型，以实现照明与反射的准确分解。

Result: 通过评估，所提出的方法在非均匀色彩照明和材料特定反射变化的条件下展示了增强的鲁棒性，同时保持较低的计算成本。

Conclusion: CL3AN 数据集和新颖的学习框架大大提升了在复杂光照场景下图片还原的效果和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Illumination in practical scenarios is inherently complex, involving colored
light sources, occlusions, and diverse material interactions that produce
intricate reflectance and shading effects. However, existing methods often
oversimplify this challenge by assuming a single light source or uniform,
white-balanced lighting, leaving many of these complexities unaddressed.In this
paper, we introduce CL3AN, the first large-scale, high-resolution dataset of
its kind designed to facilitate the restoration of images captured under
multiple Colored Light sources to their Ambient-Normalized counterparts.
Through benchmarking, we find that leading approaches often produce artifacts,
such as illumination inconsistencies, texture leakage, and color distortion,
primarily due to their limited ability to precisely disentangle illumination
from reflectance. Motivated by this insight, we achieve such a desired
decomposition through a novel learning framework that leverages explicit
chromaticity and luminance components guidance, drawing inspiration from the
principles of the Retinex model. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks
and our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing
enhanced robustness under non-homogeneous color lighting and material-specific
reflectance variations, all while maintaining a highly competitive
computational cost. The benchmark, codes, and models are available at

Result: GaussianCross在多个基准上进行了广泛评估，与先进方法相比，线性探测表现出卓越参数效率和数据效率，全面微调后在ScanNet200语义和实例分割任务上性能显著提升。

Conclusion: GaussianCross通过整合3D高斯Splatting技术，提供了一种创新的跨模态自监督3D表征学习架构，有效解决了现有挑战，如模型崩溃和结构信息不足，并展示了卓越的参数和数据效率。

Abstract: The significance of informative and robust point representations has been
widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing
self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance,
the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due
to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable
expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present
GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning
architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques
to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts
scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian
representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable
pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting
module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic
feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain
cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive
evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In
particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency,
achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and
limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities,
improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on
ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting
the effectiveness of our approach. The code, weights, and visualizations are

Conclusion: 开发了一种Python算法，能够对DICOM文件中的信息进行分类处理。通过使用自定义输入参数实现的灵活性使整个程序在日常使用和研究中都具备了很大的潜力。

Abstract: Background : De-identification of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communi-cations
in Medicine) files is an essential component of medical image research.
Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and/or Personal Health Identifying
Information (PHI) need to be hidden or removed due to legal reasons. According
to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and privacy
rules, also full-face photographic images and any compa-rable images are direct
identifiers and are considered protected health information that also need to
be de-identified. Objective : The study aimed to implement a method that permit
to de-identify the PII and PHI information present in the header and burned on
the pixel data of DICOM. Methods : To execute the de-identification, we
implemented an algorithm based on the safe harbor method, defined by HIPAA. Our
algorithm uses input customizable parameter to classify and then possibly
de-identify individual DICOM tags. Results : The most sensible information,
like names, history, personal data and institution were successfully
recognized. Conclusions : We developed a python algorithm that is able to
classify infor-mation present in a DICOM file. The flexibility provided by the
use of customi-zable input parameters, which allow the user to customize the
entire process de-pending on the case (e.g., the language), makes the entire
program very promis-ing for both everyday use and research purposes. Our code

Abstract: The spread of Deepfake videos has caused a trust crisis and impaired social
stability. Although numerous approaches have been proposed to address the
challenges of Deepfake detection and localization, there is still a lack of
systematic research on the weakly supervised multimodal fine-grained temporal
forgery localization (WS-MTFL). In this paper, we propose a novel weakly
supervised multimodal temporal forgery localization via multitask learning
(WMMT), which addresses the WS-MTFL under the multitask learning paradigm. WMMT
achieves multimodal fine-grained Deepfake detection and temporal partial
forgery localization using merely video-level annotations. Specifically, visual
and audio modality detection are formulated as two binary classification tasks.
The multitask learning paradigm is introduced to integrate these tasks into a
multimodal task. Furthermore, WMMT utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts structure to
adaptively select appropriate features and localization head, achieving
excellent flexibility and localization precision in WS-MTFL. A feature
enhancement module with temporal property preserving attention mechanism is
proposed to identify the intra- and inter-modality feature deviation and
construct comprehensive video features. To further explore the temporal
information for weakly supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving
loss has been proposed, which aims to enlarge the deviation of adjacent
segments of the forged samples and reduce the deviation of genuine samples.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of multitask learning for
WS-MTFL, and the WMMT achieves comparable results to fully supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 本论文针对量化模型在动态环境中性能下降的问题，提出了一个高效的零阶适应框架（ZOA），实验结果表明该框架可取得显著的性能提升。

Motivation: 量化模型在动态环境中容易出现域偏移导致性能下降，现有的测试时适应方法对量化模型不实用。因此需要开发适用于量化模型的测试时适应方法以提高其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Quantizing deep models prior to deployment is a widely adopted technique to
speed up inference for various real-time applications, such as autonomous
driving. However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance
degradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this
degradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision
counterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To
address the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an
effective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.
Unfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models
as they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is
unsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory
and latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to
improve their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a
continual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model
adaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden
of existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme
to store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory
consumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and
fostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental
results on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based
and CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized
model adaptation. On the quantized W6A6 ViT-B model, our ZOA is able to achieve
a 5.0\% improvement over the state-of-the-art FOA on ImageNet-C dataset. The

TL;DR: 本文提出鲁棒感知对抗训练（RPAT）方法，揭示过度学习困难对抗样本导致准确性与鲁棒性权衡问题，通过实验验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性训练虽然有效提高了深度神经网络的鲁棒性，但也带来了清晰准确性和对抗鲁棒性之间的权衡问题。本文提出新的视角，认为过度学习困难对抗样本会退化决策边界，从而引发权衡问题。为此，我们设计新的训练目标以改善这一困境。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的训练方法——鲁棒感知对抗训练（RPAT），这种方法通过鼓励模型的感知随输入扰动平稳地变化来减轻决策边界的退化问题及其导致的准确性-鲁棒性权衡。我们通过在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet数据集上的实验，展示了RPAT方法的优越效果。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet数据集上，通过对比ResNet-18、PreActResNet-18和WideResNet-34-10等模型，证明了RPAT方法优于四个常用基线和12个最新研究成果。

Conclusion: 我们的研究首次揭示了一种反直觉的现象：在感知一致性的角度来看，在对抗性训练后仍能攻击模型的困难对抗样本实际上比那些已成功防御的样本学习得更好。我们提出了一个新的对抗性训练目标，称为鲁棒感知，旨在鼓励模型的感知随输入扰动平稳地变化。我们的方法能够有效缓解当前的准确性-鲁棒性权衡。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to train
robust Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, AT creates an inherent trade-off
between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed
to the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning
of hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact
for the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard
adversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already
learned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous
views, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard
adversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the
trade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception
consistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore
the information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a
smoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its
establishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT
objective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change
smoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust
Perception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the
current accuracy-robustness trade-off. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18, PreActResNet-18, and WideResNet-34-10 demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method beyond four common baselines and 12
state-of-the-art (SOTA) works. The code is available at

TL;DR: Content-Adaptive Mamba improves image compression by dynamically reordering tokens based on content, achieving better rate-distortion performance than existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the content-agnostic nature of the vanilla Mamba model in image compression, which restricts dynamic and full exploitation of content dependencies due to its reliance on fixed, predefined selective scans.

Method: The paper introduces a dynamic state-space model (SSM) called Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM), which utilizes content-aware token reorganization and integrates global priors via a prompt dictionary, enhancing the token interactions of the Mamba model.

Result: The Content-Adaptive Mamba-based LIC model (CMIC) achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance, surpassing VTM-21.0 by significant margins (-15.91%, -21.34%, and -17.58% BD-rate) on Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks, respectively.

Conclusion: Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM) effectively addresses the limitations of vanilla Mamba in image compression by employing content-aware token reorganization and integrating global priors. This leads to improved global dependency capture while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recent Learned image compression (LIC) leverages Mamba-style state-space
models (SSMs) for global receptive fields with linear complexity. However,
vanilla Mamba is content-agnostic, relying on fixed and predefined selective
scans, which restricts its ability to dynamically and fully exploit content
dependencies. We introduce Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM), a dynamic SSM that
addresses two critical limitations. First, it employs content-aware token
reorganization, clustering and reordering tokens based on content similarity to
prioritize proximity in feature space over Euclidean space. Second, it
integrates global priors into SSM via a prompt dictionary, effectively
mitigating the strict causality and long-range decay in the token interactions
of Mamba. These innovations enable CAM to better capture global dependencies
while preserving computational efficiency. Leveraging CAM, our Content-Adaptive
Mamba-based LIC model (CMIC) achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance, surpassing VTM-21.0 by -15.91\%, -21.34\%, and -17.58\% BD-rate on
Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks, respectively.

Conclusion: COSFormer在多个WSI数据集和任务上的测试结果表明，该框架比现有的持续学习框架具有更优异的普遍性和有效性，是临床应用中持续WSI分析的有力解决方案。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, with its ability to reveal detailed tissue
structures in magnified views, plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and
computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the
rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need
for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing
models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a
system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study,
we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework
tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn
sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical
datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering
seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and
task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior
generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning
frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in
clinical applications.

TL;DR: ESI method enhances real-time intensity reconstruction for event cameras, improving runtime efficiency and image quality for UAVs under low light.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer advantages like wide dynamic range and high temporal resolution, which can be effectively utilized by extracting useful information from asynchronous event streams for challenging visual conditions.

Method: The ESI approach reconstructs intensity images by performing a single integration of the event streams combined with an enhanced decay algorithm.

Result: ESI demonstrates superior runtime efficiency improvements, better reconstruction quality, and higher frame rate than state-of-the-art algorithms, especially under low illumination conditions during UAV onboard visual tracking.

Conclusion: ESI enhances UAV onboard perception under challenging visual conditions by providing high frame rate, improved image quality, and efficient runtime performance.

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages, including a wide dynamic range,
high temporal resolution, and immunity to motion blur, making them highly
promising for addressing challenging visual conditions. Extracting and
utilizing effective information from asynchronous event streams is essential
for the onboard implementation of event cameras. In this paper, we propose a
streamlined event-based intensity reconstruction scheme, event-based single
integration (ESI), to address such implementation challenges. This method
guarantees the portability of conventional frame-based vision methods to
event-based scenarios and maintains the intrinsic advantages of event cameras.
The ESI approach reconstructs intensity images by performing a single
integration of the event streams combined with an enhanced decay algorithm.
Such a method enables real-time intensity reconstruction at a high frame rate,
typically 100 FPS. Furthermore, the relatively low computation load of ESI fits
onboard implementation suitably, such as in UAV-based visual tracking
scenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the
performance comparison of ESI and state-of-the-art algorithms. Compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, ESI demonstrates remarkable runtime efficiency
improvements, superior reconstruction quality, and a high frame rate. As a
result, ESI enhances UAV onboard perception significantly under visual
adversary surroundings. In-flight tests, ESI demonstrates effective performance
for UAV onboard visual tracking under extremely low illumination
conditions(2-10lux), whereas other comparative algorithms fail due to
insufficient frame rate, poor image quality, or limited real-time performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态缓存机制来加速Diffusion Transformers推理，并保持质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Diffusion Transformers在低资源应用推理速度慢的问题，通过利用时间步特征冗余加速推理。

Method: 通过将泰勒预测从模块级别转移到最后一个块级别，减少缓存特征数量，利用第一个块的泰勒估计与实际输出之间的误差判断预测的可靠性，启用动态缓存机制。

Result: 在FLUX上实现了3.17倍的加速，在DiT上实现了2.36倍的加速，在Wan Video上实现了4.14倍的加速，并且几乎没有质量下降。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于动态缓存机制的泰勒预测方法，旨在加速Diffusion Transformers的推理速度，同时保持生成图像的质量。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their
deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches
exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past
representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer
instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.
However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,
attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate
features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it
adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of
predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when
prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to
better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor
prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly
reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong
sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error
between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an
indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor
prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,
thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our
method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x
acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible
quality drop. The Project Page is

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新型的基于大型语言模型（LLM）的多模态实体链接框架，能够有效解决现有方法中的一些局限性，并在多个公开数据集上取得了优异的实验结果。

Abstract: Multimodal entity linking plays a crucial role in a wide range of
applications. Recent advances in large language model-based methods have become
the dominant paradigm for this task, effectively leveraging both textual and
visual modalities to enhance performance. Despite their success, these methods
still face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in
certain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual
features, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal
entity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections.
This framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task.
When text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and
inter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that
integrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support
reasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely
used public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%,
5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. Our code is available at

Conclusion: DerProp展示了在增强伪标签可靠性方面超越其他方法的优势。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which leverages a limited set of
labeled images, helps to relieve the heavy annotation burden. While
pseudo-labeling strategies yield promising results, there is still room for
enhancing the reliability of pseudo-labels. Hence, we develop a semi-supervised
framework, namely DerProp, equipped with a novel derivative label propagation
to rectify imperfect pseudo-labels. Our label propagation method imposes
discrete derivative operations on pixel-wise feature vectors as additional
regularization, thereby generating strictly regularized similarity metrics.
Doing so effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem that identical
similarities correspond to different features, through constraining the
solution space. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the rationality
of our design, and demonstrate our superiority over other methods. Codes are

Result: Patho-AgenticRAG shows significant performance improvements in complex pathology tasks compared to existing models, demonstrating enhanced capability in reasoning and search interactions.

Conclusion: Patho-AgenticRAG significantly outperforms existing multimodal models in complex pathology tasks, improving accuracy in tasks like multiple-choice diagnosis and visual question answering.

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong generalization in
medical imaging, pathology presents unique challenges due to ultra-high
resolution, complex tissue structures, and nuanced clinical semantics. These
factors make pathology VLMs prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating outputs
inconsistent with visual evidence, which undermines clinical trust. Existing
RAG approaches in this domain largely depend on text-based knowledge bases,
limiting their ability to leverage diagnostic visual cues. To address this, we
propose Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with a database built on
page-level embeddings from authoritative pathology textbooks. Unlike
traditional text-only retrieval systems, it supports joint text-image search,
enabling direct retrieval of textbook pages that contain both the queried text
and relevant visual cues, thus avoiding the loss of critical image-based
information. Patho-AgenticRAG also supports reasoning, task decomposition, and
multi-turn search interactions, improving accuracy in complex diagnostic
scenarios. Experiments show that Patho-AgenticRAG significantly outperforms
existing multimodal models in complex pathology tasks like multiple-choice
diagnosis and visual question answering. Our project is available at the

Result: 在Occ-ScanNet数据集上实现了最先进的表现，IoU提升超过6.3%，mIoU提升4.1%，同时延迟和内存消耗减少了9.3%以上。

Conclusion: SplatSSC框架通过深度引导初始化策略和高斯聚合器克服了现有方法的局限性，显著提高了单目3D语义场景补全任务的性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a challenging yet promising
task that aims to infer dense geometric and semantic descriptions of a scene
from a single image. While recent object-centric paradigms significantly
improve efficiency by leveraging flexible 3D Gaussian primitives, they still
rely heavily on a large number of randomly initialized primitives, which
inevitably leads to 1) inefficient primitive initialization and 2) outlier
primitives that introduce erroneous artifacts. In this paper, we propose
SplatSSC, a novel framework that resolves these limitations with a depth-guided
initialization strategy and a principled Gaussian aggregator. Instead of random
initialization, SplatSSC utilizes a dedicated depth branch composed of a
Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion (GMF) module, which integrates multi-scale image
and depth features to generate a sparse yet representative set of initial
Gaussian primitives. To mitigate noise from outlier primitives, we develop the
Decoupled Gaussian Aggregator (DGA), which enhances robustness by decomposing
geometric and semantic predictions during the Gaussian-to-voxel splatting
process. Complemented with a specialized Probability Scale Loss, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ-ScanNet dataset, outperforming
prior approaches by over 6.3% in IoU and 4.1% in mIoU, while reducing both
latency and memory consumption by more than 9.3%. The code will be released
upon acceptance.

Method: 提出了一种新颖的半监督双阈值对比学习策略，称为Hermes，结合了对比学习与半监督学习的优势，并开发了跨任务注意和显著性模块以及跨任务一致性学习策略，以促进信息共享和避免负迁移。

Result: 在两个公共超声数据集和一个私有数据集上的大量实验显示，Hermes在各种半监督设置中始终优于多种最新方法。

Conclusion: Hermes consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in semi-supervised settings for ultrasound image classification and segmentation.

Abstract: Confidence-based pseudo-label selection usually generates overly confident
yet incorrect predictions, due to the early misleadingness of model and
overfitting inaccurate pseudo-labels in the learning process, which heavily
degrades the performance of semi-supervised contrastive learning. Moreover,
segmentation and classification tasks are treated independently and the
affinity fails to be fully explored. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised dual-threshold contrastive learning strategy for
ultrasound image classification and segmentation, named Hermes. This strategy
combines the strengths of contrastive learning with semi-supervised learning,
where the pseudo-labels assist contrastive learning by providing additional
guidance. Specifically, an inter-task attention and saliency module is also
developed to facilitate information sharing between the segmentation and
classification tasks. Furthermore, an inter-task consistency learning strategy
is designed to align tumor features across both tasks, avoiding negative
transfer for reducing features discrepancy. To solve the lack of publicly
available ultrasound datasets, we have collected the SZ-TUS dataset, a thyroid
ultrasound image dataset. Extensive experiments on two public ultrasound
datasets and one private dataset demonstrate that Hermes consistently
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods across various semi-supervised
settings.

TL;DR: 引入SGAD方法解决局部特征匹配效率和准确性问题，显著减少运行时间并提升姿态估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的区域到点匹配方法依赖于低效的像素级比较和复杂的图匹配，这限制了可扩展性。因此，提出一种能够在无需复杂图优化的情况下直接匹配的区域描述符方案以提高匹配效率和准确性。

Method: 引入语义和几何感知描述符网络（SGAD），通过生成高度判别力的区域描述符，从根本上重新思考基于区域的匹配。此外，通过一种将区域匹配任务分解为分类和排序子任务的新监督策略来提高性能，并引入层次包含冗余过滤器（HCRF）来消除重叠区域。

Result: 在与MESA的对比中，SGAD大幅减少了运行时间（0.82s vs. 60.23s）。在多个点匹配器的广泛评估中，SGAD+LoFTR比DKM减少了运行时间，同时在户外姿态估计中实现了更高的准确性（0.82s vs. 1.51s, 65.98 vs. 61.11），而SGAD+ROMA在室内姿态估计中实现了+7.39% AUC@5°，建立了新的技术标杆。

Conclusion: SGAD方法实现了显著性能提升，降低了运行时间，并在不同点匹配器上表现出了持续的改进。

Abstract: Local feature matching remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision.
Recent Area to Point Matching (A2PM) methods have improved matching accuracy.
However, existing research based on this framework relies on inefficient
pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching that limit scalability. In
this work, we introduce the Semantic and Geometric-aware Descriptor Network
(SGAD), which fundamentally rethinks area-based matching by generating highly
discriminative area descriptors that enable direct matching without complex
graph optimization. This approach significantly improves both accuracy and
efficiency of area matching. We further improve the performance of area
matching through a novel supervision strategy that decomposes the area matching
task into classification and ranking subtasks. Finally, we introduce the
Hierarchical Containment Redundancy Filter (HCRF) to eliminate overlapping
areas by analyzing containment graphs. SGAD demonstrates remarkable performance
gains, reducing runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA. Extensive
evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple point matchers:
SGAD+LoFTR reduces runtime compared to DKM, while achieving higher accuracy

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究边缘预处理对不同医学图像模态分割的影响，提出元学习策略提升整体分割性能16.42%到19.30%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基础模型的预训练和微调可以增强分割性能，但不同的图像预处理步骤如何影响各种医学成像模态上的分割表现仍不明确，尤其是边缘像素强度突然过渡的重要角色没有被系统地研究。

Method: 我们研究了使用计算上有效的边缘核预处理数据进行预训练的方法，例如使用Kirsch边缘核，以改善基础模型的跨模态分割能力。我们还提出了一种元学习策略来指导选择性的应用。

Result: 传统预处理仅集中于边缘的基础模型在某些模态上表现优异，而在其他模态上表现不佳。而整合元学习层后，我们的实验表明，分割性能整体提升16.42%，相较于仅在增强边缘数据上预训练的模型提升幅度为19.30%。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一种元学习策略，通过使用标准差和图像熵来选择模型进行预训练，以实现跨多种医学图像任务的优化分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment
planning, yet developing robust segmentation models often requires substantial
computational resources and large datasets. Existing research shows that
pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance.
However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may
influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities.
In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely
acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been
systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address
this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed
using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve
cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of
a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across
multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets
tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using
the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and
XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across
modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective
application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose
a meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the
raw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data
for optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this
meta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement
across diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained
on edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw
data only.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种仅依赖事件相机的立体3D检测框架，在动态环境中实现鲁棒的连续时间3D感知，优于之前的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事件相机与传统传感器整合的方法在高速度动况中表现不佳，需要依赖同步传感器。因此，我们希望通过仅使用事件相机来消除传统3D传感器的需求，解决这个问题。

Method: 我们引入了一种新的立体3D目标检测框架，仅依赖事件相机，并引入双过滤机制以提取语义和几何信息，同时通过对齐边界框和对象中心信息来增强回归。

Result: 我们的方法在动态环境中优于之前的方案，证明了事件相机在连续时间3D感知中的潜力。

Conclusion: 我们的研究表明，事件相机可以通过新的3D检测框架，在动态环境中实现更为鲁棒的连续时间3D感知。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous systems, enabling precise
localization and dimension estimation. While LiDAR and RGB cameras are widely
used, their fixed frame rates create perception gaps in high-speed scenarios.
Event cameras, with their asynchronous nature and high temporal resolution,
offer a solution by capturing motion continuously. The recent approach, which
integrates event cameras with conventional sensors for continuous-time
detection, struggles in fast-motion scenarios due to its dependency on
synchronized sensors. We propose a novel stereo 3D object detection framework
that relies solely on event cameras, eliminating the need for conventional 3D
sensors. To compensate for the lack of semantic and geometric information in
event data, we introduce a dual filter mechanism that extracts both.
Additionally, we enhance regression by aligning bounding boxes with
object-centric information. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior
approaches in dynamic environments, demonstrating the potential of event
cameras for robust, continuous-time 3D perception. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CoMet方法用于无需人工筛选的数据集的异常检测，通过赋权和正则化更新提高性能，在多个数据集上实现了新的性能标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的无监督异常检测技术通常假定所有的训练数据均为正常数据，这种假设虽然简化了训练过程，但需要人工筛选数据，导致偏差且限制了适应性。因此，研究的动机在于去除这种假设限制，解决数据筛选问题。

Method: 该方法综合应用了软置信学习（Soft Confident Learning）和元学习（Meta-Learning），通过置信赋权方式降低低置信样本的权重，并通过正则化更新和训练验证损失协方差稳定训练过程，从而防止过拟合并增强模型对噪声数据的稳健性。

Result: 实验结果表明，CoMet方法在MVTec-AD、VIADUCT和KSDD2数据集上的两个最先进模型上表现优异，不仅稳定改善了基线方法的效果，而且对训练数据集中的异常样本不敏感。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的Confident Meta-learning (CoMet)方法能够有效提高深度异常检测模型的性能，在无需显式过滤的情况下，从未经筛选的数据集中进行学习，并在所有测试数据集中建立了新的模型性能标准。

Abstract: So-called unsupervised anomaly detection is better described as
semi-supervised, as it assumes all training data are nominal. This assumption
simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and
limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel
training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from
uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the
need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning,
which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which
stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss
covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data.
CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method
trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2
with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to
anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all
datasets.

Motivation: 目前的影像风险预测算法往往单一聚焦某个特定疾病，并依赖通过分割工具获取的手工特征，存在局限性。旨在提供一种更全面和无监督的方法，提升对多种疾病的风险预测能力。

Method: 本研究提出了一种自监督表示学习方法，用于全身影像数据的预临床疾病风险评估，并采用竞争风险建模进行分析。

Result: 该方法在心血管疾病（CVD）、2型糖尿病（T2D）、慢性阻塞性肺病（COPD）和慢性肾病（CKD）的预测中优于全身影像组学方法，并在结合心脏MRI后，显著提升心血管疾病子组的预测效果。

Conclusion: 研究展示了全身自监督表示学习方法在多种疾病风险预测中的优越性，特别是在结合心脏MRI用于心血管疾病子组的预测中表现突出，表明其在临床流程中作为独立筛查模式或多模态框架一部分的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Reliable preclinical disease risk assessment is essential to move public
healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive identification and prevention.
However, image-based risk prediction algorithms often consider one condition at
a time and depend on hand-crafted features obtained through segmentation tools.
We propose a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method for the
preclinical disease risk assessment under a competing risk modeling. This
approach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including
cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a
preclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it
sharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease
(IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the
translational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening
modality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for
early personalized risk stratification. The code is available at

TL;DR: AI模型需要在人类专家的协助下安全应用，不确定性量化方法可能比学习的推迟模型对分布外数据更稳健，有助于推迟错误预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床应用中，AI模型常常会面临数据分布变化等挑战，因此需要能够推迟决策的策略以保障安全实施。

Method: 通过在大型眼科数据集上进行广泛评估研究，比较学习的推迟模型与现有的不确定性量化方法，在分布内和分布外的性能。

Result: 不确定性量化方法在分布外输入上的表现比学习的推迟模型更为稳定，并可能是AI模型推迟决策的一种有希望的策略选择。

Conclusion: AI模型需要与人为决策相结合，以确保安全的实施。不确定性量化方法可能是进行AI推迟决策的更好选择。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to dramatically improve
patient care. However, it is not infallible, necessitating
human-AI-collaboration to ensure safe implementation. One aspect of AI safety
is the models' ability to defer decisions to a human expert when they are
likely to misclassify autonomously. Recent research has focused on methods that
learn to defer by optimising a surrogate loss function that finds the optimal
trade-off between predicting a class label or deferring. However, during
clinical translation, models often face challenges such as data shift.
Uncertainty quantification methods aim to estimate a model's confidence in its
predictions. However, they may also be used as a deferral strategy which does
not rely on learning from specific training distribution. We hypothesise that
models developed to quantify uncertainty are more robust to out-of-distribution
(OOD) input than learned deferral models that have been trained in a supervised
fashion. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed an extensive evaluation
study on a large ophthalmology dataset, examining both learned deferral models
and established uncertainty quantification methods, assessing their performance
in- and out-of-distribution. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to
accurately classify glaucoma from fundus images while deferring cases with a
high likelihood of error. We find that uncertainty quantification methods may
be a promising choice for AI deferral.

Method: 提出一个逻辑驱动的ZS-CAR框架LogicCAR，通过集成双重符号约束来解决问题：显式组合逻辑和层次原语逻辑。

Result: LogicCAR在Sth-com数据集上的实验结果优于现有的基线方法，证明了其逻辑驱动约束的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，仿人类符号推理能够有效解决ZS-CAR中的挑战，通过在神经网络中嵌入一阶逻辑约束来桥接符号抽象和现有模型。

Abstract: Zero-shot compositional action recognition (ZS-CAR) aims to identify unseen
verb-object compositions in the videos by exploiting the learned knowledge of
verb and object primitives during training. Despite compositional learning's
progress in ZS-CAR, two critical challenges persist: 1) Missing compositional
structure constraint, leading to spurious correlations between primitives; 2)
Neglecting semantic hierarchy constraint, leading to semantic ambiguity and
impairing the training process. In this paper, we argue that human-like
symbolic reasoning offers a principled solution to these challenges by
explicitly modeling compositional and hierarchical structured abstraction. To
this end, we propose a logic-driven ZS-CAR framework LogicCAR that integrates
dual symbolic constraints: Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical
Primitive Logic. Specifically, the former models the restrictions within the
compositions, enhancing the compositional reasoning ability of our model. The
latter investigates the semantical dependencies among different primitives,
empowering the models with fine-to-coarse reasoning capacity. By formalizing
these constraints in first-order logic and embedding them into neural network
architectures, LogicCAR systematically bridges the gap between symbolic
abstraction and existing models. Extensive experiments on the Sth-com dataset
demonstrate that our LogicCAR outperforms existing baseline methods, proving
the effectiveness of our logic-driven constraints.

Result: 在KITTI-360和Waymo数据集上，该方法在多视角监督的最先进基准测试中表现相当或更好，并且在处理动态场景方面具有独特优势。

Conclusion: 我们的实验表明，该方法在KITTI-360和Waymo数据集上的表现与使用多视角监督的最先进的基准方法相当或更好，并在处理动态场景方面具有独特优势。

Abstract: Volumetric scene reconstruction from a single image is crucial for a broad
range of applications like autonomous driving and robotics. Recent volumetric
reconstruction methods achieve impressive results, but generally require
expensive 3D ground truth or multi-view supervision. We propose to leverage
pre-trained 2D diffusion models and depth prediction models to generate
synthetic scene geometry from a single image. This can then be used to distill
a feed-forward scene reconstruction model. Our experiments on the challenging
KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets demonstrate that our method matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines that use multi-view supervision, and offers unique
advantages, for example regarding dynamic scenes.

Result: 在字母语言和比较具有挑战性的语系如中文方面表现优异，实现了图像生成和编辑的最先进性能。

Conclusion: Qwen-Image在图像生成和编辑方面表现卓越，跨多个基准测试展示了强大的能力。

Abstract: We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen
series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise
image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a
comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection,
filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a
progressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering,
evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to
paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially
enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result,
Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as
English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic
languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an
improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional
text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also
image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent
representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed
the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and
reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism
enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic
consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both
image generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: 尽管像CLIP这样的视觉-语言模型在视觉和语言的对齐方面取得了成功，但在细致的视觉理解能力上仍面临挑战。研究旨在改善CLIP的细粒度感知能力。

Method: 提出了CLIP-IN框架，通过使用指令编辑数据集来提供困难的负面图像-文本对，并结合对称硬负对比损失，以及使用长描述性标题和旋转位置编码来捕捉详细语义上下文。

Result: 实验证明，CLIP-IN在MMVP基准测试和各种细粒度视觉识别任务上取得了显著的进步，同时在广泛的分类和检索任务上保持了强大的零样本性能。将CLIP-IN的视觉表示集成到多模态大型语言模型中显著减少了视觉幻觉并增强了推理能力。

Conclusion: 将指令为基础的对比学习与全面的描述性信息结合能够显著提升视觉-语言模型的细粒度理解能力。

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning
vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual
comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework
that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations.
Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for
image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs.
Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model
to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly,
CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional
encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our
experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP
benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without
compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and
retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into
Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations
and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable
potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with
comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding
of VLMs.

Motivation: 现有的球面模式旋转估计方法计算复杂度较高，且在大量异常值存在的情况下缺乏充分评估。为此，提出一种计算复杂度较低且能有效处理异常值的旋转估计算法。

Method: 本文提出了一种线性时间复杂度 $O(n)$ 的旋转估计算法，通过将球面图案显式表示为单位球上的离散 3D 点集，将旋转估计重新表述为球面点集对齐问题。具体引入了三个新算法：SPMC、FRS 和 SPMC+FRS 混合方法。

Result: 我们的实验表明，在 $\mathbb{S}^2$ 域中和无对应设置中，本文的算法比当前最先进的方法快 10 倍，准确性提高 10 倍。

Conclusion: 通过实验验证，本文提出的算法在无对应情况下的 Wahba 问题求解中比当前最先进的方法快 10 倍且准确性提高 10 倍。

Abstract: Existing methods for rotation estimation between two spherical
($\mathbb{S}^2$) patterns typically rely on spherical cross-correlation
maximization between two spherical function. However, these approaches exhibit
computational complexities greater than cubic $O(n^3)$ with respect to rotation
space discretization and lack extensive evaluation under significant outlier
contamination. To this end, we propose a rotation estimation algorithm between
two spherical patterns with linear time complexity $O(n)$. Unlike existing
spherical-function-based methods, we explicitly represent spherical patterns as
discrete 3D point sets on the unit sphere, reformulating rotation estimation as
a spherical point-set alignment (i.e., Wahba problem for 3D unit vectors).
Given the geometric nature of our formulation, our spherical pattern alignment
algorithm naturally aligns with the Wahba problem framework for 3D unit
vectors. Specifically, we introduce three novel algorithms: (1) SPMC (Spherical
Pattern Matching by Correlation), (2) FRS (Fast Rotation Search), and (3) a
hybrid approach (SPMC+FRS) that combines the advantages of the previous two
methods. Our experiments demonstrate that in the $\mathbb{S}^2$ domain and in
correspondence-free settings, our algorithms are over 10x faster and over 10x
more accurate than current state-of-the-art methods for the Wahba problem with
outliers. We validate our approach through extensive simulations on a new
dataset of spherical patterns, the ``Robust Vector Alignment Dataset.
"Furthermore, we adapt our methods to two real-world tasks: (i) Point Cloud
Registration (PCR) and (ii) rotation estimation for spherical images.

Motivation: 现有的AVS方法忽视了特征空间的多样性，难以充分利用个体特征的表达能力。

Method: LPD通过学习特定视频和文本特征的公共空间，并采用去相关损失和基于熵的公平多空间三元组排名损失来实现。

Result: 在TRECVID AVS基准测试（2016-2023）中，LPD方法展示出了其有效性，并通过多样性可视化进一步强调其提高搜索结果多样性的能力。

Conclusion: LPD方法能够有效提升视频搜索结果的多样性和准确性。

Abstract: Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) involves using a textual query to search for
multiple relevant videos in a large collection of unlabeled short videos. The
main challenge of AVS is the visual diversity of relevant videos. A simple
query such as "Find shots of a man and a woman dancing together indoors" can
span a multitude of environments, from brightly lit halls and shadowy bars to
dance scenes in black-and-white animations. It is therefore essential to
retrieve relevant videos as comprehensively as possible. Current solutions for
the AVS task primarily fuse multiple features into one or more common spaces,
yet overlook the need for diverse spaces. To fully exploit the expressive
capability of individual features, we propose LPD, short for Learning Partially
Decorrelated common spaces. LPD incorporates two key innovations:
feature-specific common space construction and the de-correlation loss.
Specifically, LPD learns a separate common space for each video and text
feature, and employs de-correlation loss to diversify the ordering of negative
samples across different spaces. To enhance the consistency of multi-space
convergence, we designed an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking
loss. Extensive experiments on the TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) justify
the effectiveness of LPD. Moreover, diversity visualizations of LPD's spaces
highlight its ability to enhance result diversity.

Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban
environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems.
While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such
scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions
caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult.
Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual
information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in
NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar
PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS
pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera
to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments
conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The
localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS
driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.

Conclusion: Text2Lip框架有效地解决了语音驱动方法在唇动生成中的语义和视觉一致性问题，提供了一种可控且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating semantically coherent and visually accurate talking faces requires
bridging the gap between linguistic meaning and facial articulation. Although
audio-driven methods remain prevalent, their reliance on high-quality paired
audio visual data and the inherent ambiguity in mapping acoustics to lip motion
pose significant challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. To address
these issues, we propose Text2Lip, a viseme-centric framework that constructs
an interpretable phonetic-visual bridge by embedding textual input into
structured viseme sequences. These mid-level units serve as a linguistically
grounded prior for lip motion prediction. Furthermore, we design a progressive
viseme-audio replacement strategy based on curriculum learning, enabling the
model to gradually transition from real audio to pseudo-audio reconstructed
from enhanced viseme features via cross-modal attention. This allows for robust
generation in both audio-present and audio-free scenarios. Finally, a
landmark-guided renderer synthesizes photorealistic facial videos with accurate
lip synchronization. Extensive evaluations show that Text2Lip outperforms
existing approaches in semantic fidelity, visual realism, and modality
robustness, establishing a new paradigm for controllable and flexible talking
face generation. Our project homepage is https://plyon1.github.io/Text2Lip/.

Motivation: The aim is to find an optimal balance between reconstruction fidelity and editing flexibility in image inversion for practical editing applications.

Method: OTIP leverages optimal transport theory to guide the inversion process in rectified flow models by computing optimal transport paths between image and noise distributions during the reverse diffusion process.

Result: The method achieves high-fidelity reconstruction, with metrics such as LPIPS scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks. It shows improvements in reconstruction loss of 7.8% to 12.9% on LSUN-Bedroom and LSUN-Church datasets and improves identity preservation by 11.2% and perceptual quality by 1.6% in semantic face editing tasks.

Conclusion: OTIP demonstrates an effective solution for image inversion in rectified flow models, achieving a balance between reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability.

Abstract: Effective image inversion in rectified flow models - mapping real images to
editable latent representations - is crucial for practical image editing
applications; however, achieving optimal balance between reconstruction
fidelity and editing flexibility remains a fundamental challenge. In this work,
we introduce the Optimal Transport Inversion Pipeline (OTIP), a zero-shot
framework that leverages optimal transport theory to guide the inversion
process in rectified flow models. Our underlying hypothesis is that
incorporating transport-based guidance during the reverse diffusion process can
effectively balance reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability through
principled trajectory optimization. The method computes optimal transport paths
between image and noise distributions while maintaining computational
efficiency. Our approach achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS
scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, demonstrating
superior preservation of fine-grained details compared to existing methods. We
evaluate the framework across multiple editing tasks, observing 7.8% to 12.9%
improvements in reconstruction loss over RF-Inversion on the LSUN-Bedroom and
LSUN-Church datasets, respectively. For semantic face editing, our method
achieves an 11.2% improvement in identity preservation and a 1.6% enhancement
in perceptual quality, while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to
baseline approaches. Qualitatively, our method produces visually compelling
edits with superior semantic consistency and fine-grained detail preservation
across diverse editing scenarios. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 为提高港口物流效率，发布了 TRUDI 数据集及 TITUS 识别系统，解决了多样化场景下的运输单元识别问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 港口物流效率提升需要识别运输单元（TUs），但缺乏多样化和动态的可用基准数据集限制了该领域的进展。

Method: 提出 TITUS，涵盖三个阶段：TU 实例分割、ID 文字位置检测、识别与验证提取的 ID。评估显示 TITUS 在多种摄像视角及不同光照和天气条件下可靠地识别 TUs。

Result: TITUS 能从多种拍摄角度和条件下可靠地识别运输单元。同时提供了一个公共的基准数据集 TRUDI，以支持相关领域的新方法开发和比较。

Conclusion: TRUDI 数据集的公开发布为多用途港口的数字化转型提供了支持，有助于提高整个物流链的效率。

Abstract: Identifying transportation units (TUs) is essential for improving the
efficiency of port logistics. However, progress in this field has been hindered
by the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets that capture the diversity
and dynamics of real-world port environments. To address this gap, we present
the TRUDI dataset-a comprehensive collection comprising 35,034 annotated
instances across five categories: container, tank container, trailer, ID text,
and logo. The images were captured at operational ports using both ground-based
and aerial cameras, under a wide variety of lighting and weather conditions.
For the identification of TUs-which involves reading the 11-digit alphanumeric
ID typically painted on each unit-we introduce TITUS, a dedicated pipeline that
operates in three stages: (1) segmenting the TU instances, (2) detecting the
location of the ID text, and (3) recognising and validating the extracted ID.
Unlike alternative systems, which often require similar scenes, specific camera
angles or gate setups, our evaluation demonstrates that TITUS reliably
identifies TUs from a range of camera perspectives and in varying lighting and
weather conditions. By making the TRUDI dataset publicly available, we provide
a robust benchmark that enables the development and comparison of new
approaches. This contribution supports digital transformation efforts in
multipurpose ports and helps to increase the efficiency of entire logistics
chains.

TL;DR: 提出Uni-Layout框架，通过统一生成和人类模拟评估以及动态优化技术，显著提升布局生成方法的适用性和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前布局生成方法存在任务特定的生成能力问题以及感知不一致的评估标准，导致适用性有限和测量无效。

Method: 该论文提出名为Uni-Layout的新框架，实现统一生成、人类模拟评估以及两者之间的统一。为了实现通用生成，论文将各种布局任务整合到一个单一分类中，并开发了一个统一生成器，通过自然语言提示处理背景或元素内容限制任务。此外，论文建立了Layout-HF100k，这是第一个包含10万个人工反馈的大规模数据集，用于有效评估布局。基于Layout-HF100k，论文引入人类模拟评估器，结合视觉和几何信息，使用链式逻辑机制进行定性评估，以及一个信心水平估算模块进行定量测量。为了更好地协调生成器和评估器，论文通过采用动态边际偏好优化（DMPO）将其整合成一个连贯系统，该方法根据偏好强度动态调整边缘以更好地符合人类判断。

Result: 经过广泛实验表明，Uni-Layout在性能上明显优于任务特定和通用方法。

Conclusion: Uni-Layout框架实现了统一生成和人类模拟评估的整合，并通过动态边际偏好优化有效增强了生成器与评估器的协调性，显著提升了布局生成的适用性和效果。

Abstract: Layout generation plays a crucial role in enhancing both user experience and
design efficiency. However, current approaches suffer from task-specific
generation capabilities and perceptually misaligned evaluation metrics, leading
to limited applicability and ineffective measurement. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Uni-Layout}, a novel framework that achieves unified generation,
human-mimicking evaluation and alignment between the two. For universal
generation, we incorporate various layout tasks into a single taxonomy and
develop a unified generator that handles background or element contents
constrained tasks via natural language prompts. To introduce human feedback for
the effective evaluation of layouts, we build \textit{Layout-HF100k}, the first
large-scale human feedback dataset with 100,000 expertly annotated layouts.
Based on \textit{Layout-HF100k}, we introduce a human-mimicking evaluator that
integrates visual and geometric information, employing a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism to conduct qualitative assessments alongside a confidence estimation
module to yield quantitative measurements. For better alignment between the
generator and the evaluator, we integrate them into a cohesive system by
adopting Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO), which dynamically
adjusts margins based on preference strength to better align with human
judgments. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Uni-Layout} significantly
outperforms both task-specific and general-purpose methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/JD-GenX/Uni-Layout.

Conclusion: SMART-Ship数据集可以促进多模态远程感知任务的开展，并为进一步研究指明方向。

Abstract: Given the limitations of satellite orbits and imaging conditions, multi-modal
remote sensing (RS) data is crucial in enabling long-term earth observation.
However, maritime surveillance remains challenging due to the complexity of
multi-scale targets and the dynamic environments. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose a Synchronized Multi-modal Aligned Remote sensing Targets dataset
for berthed ships analysis (SMART-Ship), containing spatiotemporal registered
images with fine-grained annotation for maritime targets from five modalities:
visible-light, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), panchromatic, multi-spectral,
and near-infrared. Specifically, our dataset consists of 1092 multi-modal image
sets, covering 38,838 ships. Each image set is acquired within one week and
registered to ensure spatiotemporal consistency. Ship instances in each set are
annotated with polygonal location information, fine-grained categories,
instance-level identifiers, and change region masks, organized hierarchically
to support diverse multi-modal RS tasks. Furthermore, we define standardized
benchmarks on five fundamental tasks and comprehensively compare representative
methods across the dataset. Thorough experiment evaluations validate that the
proposed SMART-Ship dataset could support various multi-modal RS interpretation
tasks and reveal the promising directions for further exploration.

Motivation: 旨在推进无监督对象定位领域，通过设计简洁的方法提高性能。

Method: COLER通过CutOnce方法生成粗糙的伪标签，然后通过这些标签进行学习。CutOnce不依赖于任何聚类方法，可以生成多对象的掩码。

Result: COLER不需要特殊的伪标签损失函数，在自训练过程中性能进一步提升，并在多个基准测试中超越了之前的方法。

Conclusion: COLER方法在无监督实例分割和目标检测领域取得了优异的性能，超越了之前的最佳方法。

Abstract: We propose Cut-Once-and-LEaRn (COLER), a simple approach for unsupervised
instance segmentation and object detection. COLER first uses our developed
CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels, then enables the detector to learn
from these masks. CutOnce applies Normalized Cut only once and does not rely on
any clustering methods, but it can generate multiple object masks in an image.
We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce
to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised models,
but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER
achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions
for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through
self-training. COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model that outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.We believe our method
can help advance the field of unsupervised object localization.

Method: 采用毫米波雷达结合相机技术，通过设计卷积神经网络融合毫米波深度图像与RGB图像，再开发基于变压器的编码器生成特征映射用于分类检测。

Conclusion: Hydra展示了在实际农业环境中高效准确检测叶子湿润时间的潜力，准确率在不同场景下达到96%，在真实农场中仍保持约90%的准确率。

Abstract: Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), the time that water remains on leaf surfaces, is
crucial in the development of plant diseases. Existing LWD detection lacks
standardized measurement techniques, and variations across different plant
characteristics limit its effectiveness. Prior research proposes diverse
approaches, but they fail to measure real natural leaves directly and lack
resilience in various environmental conditions. This reduces the precision and
robustness, revealing a notable practical application and effectiveness gap in
real-world agricultural settings. This paper presents Hydra, an innovative
approach that integrates millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) radar with camera technology
to detect leaf wetness by determining if there is water on the leaf. We can
measure the time to determine the LWD based on this detection. Firstly, we
design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to selectively fuse multiple
mm-Wave depth images with an RGB image to generate multiple feature images.
Then, we develop a transformer-based encoder to capture the inherent connection
among the multiple feature images to generate a feature map, which is further
fed to a classifier for detection. Moreover, we augment the dataset during
training to generalize our model. Implemented using a frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW) radar within the 76 to 81 GHz band, Hydra's performance
is meticulously evaluated on plants, demonstrating the potential to classify
leaf wetness with up to 96% accuracy across varying scenarios. Deploying Hydra
in the farm, including rainy, dawn, or poorly light nights, it still achieves
an accuracy rate of around 90%.

<details>

Motivation: 复杂时间序列数据因其高维性、动态性和变量间复杂的相互作用，使得分析变得困难。本文受到超图强大的结构建模能力的启发，提出解决这个问题的新方法。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于超图的时间序列转换器主干网络，称为HGTS-Former。首先，将多变量时间序列信号标准化并嵌入为tokens，然后采用多头自注意力机制增强每个片段的时间表示。接着，构建层次化超图聚合每个通道内的时序模式和不同变量之间的细粒度关系。使用EdgeToNode模块将超边转换为节点特征，并采用前馈网络进一步增强输出特征。

Result: 在两个多变量时间序列任务和八个数据集上进行的广泛实验充分验证了HGTS-Former的有效性。

Conclusion: HGTS-Former能够有效解决多变量时间序列数据中的复杂耦合问题，并通过实验验证了其在多个任务和数据集上的优越性能。

Abstract: Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research
topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time
series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high
dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables.
Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this
paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone
network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time
series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first
normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head
self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The
hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns
within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables.
After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode
module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output
features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks
and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed
HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型视觉-语言模型中的对象幻觉问题，揭示模态偏置现象。提出了一种无训练方法，通过调整注意力权重和采用对比解码策略，显著缓解了幻觉问题。实验显示此方法具有广泛适用性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型视觉-语言模型在多模态理解和推理方面表现出色，但仍面临严重的对象幻觉问题。该问题主要归因于视觉编码器和大型语言模型之间的规模不匹配导致的语言先验。然而，研究发现LVLM在幻觉生成时不仅可能忽视视觉信息，还可能忽视文本模态，称之为模态偏置。

Method: 本文提出了一种简单但有效的无训练方法，通过介入和调整文本和视觉令牌的注意力权重，平衡跨模态兼容性。此外，作者采用一种对比解码策略，以减少LVLM对其参数知识的过度依赖，增强注意力操控效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，模态偏置在LVLM中普遍存在。所提出的方法能够有效缓解多个开源LVLM和基准测试中的幻觉现象，突出其广泛的通用性和效果。

Conclusion: 本文总结表明，通过调整文本和视觉令牌的注意力权重，可以有效缓解LVLM中的对象幻觉现象。采用对比解码策略进一步减少LVLM对其参数知识的过度依赖，从而改善多模态兼容性和用户意图的对齐。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
comprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe
object hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to
linguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large
language models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon
LLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,
generating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an
in-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a
previously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information
but also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality
bias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both
visual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of
user-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet
effective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we
intervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,
balancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.
Furthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's
overreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our
attention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence
of modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates
hallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting
its generalizability and efficacy.

Conclusion: 本文通过利用视觉Transformer直接从MRI图像中提取隐藏特征，提出了一种新的AI方法来预测总生存期，该方法无需肿瘤分割，简化了流程并降低了计算资源需求。

Abstract: Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and common brain tumors, with a
median survival of 10-15 months. Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical
for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with
patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence
(AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images,
exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from
MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional
approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational
resource requirements.
  The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy
of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods.
Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall,
and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size
limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets
compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is
observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability
of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for
OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on
segmentation.

Conclusion: InfoSyncNet在静音视频语音内容估计中的表现优于现有的技术，取得了92.0%和60.7%的Top-1准确率。

Abstract: Estimating spoken content from silent videos is crucial for applications in
Assistive Technology (AT) and Augmented Reality (AR). However, accurately
mapping lip movement sequences in videos to words poses significant challenges
due to variability across sequences and the uneven distribution of information
within each sequence. To tackle this, we introduce InfoSyncNet, a non-uniform
sequence modeling network enhanced by tailored data augmentation techniques.
Central to InfoSyncNet is a non-uniform quantization module positioned between
the encoder and decoder, enabling dynamic adjustment to the network's focus and
effectively handling the natural inconsistencies in visual speech data.
Additionally, multiple training strategies are incorporated to enhance the
model's capability to handle variations in lighting and the speaker's
orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the LRW and LRW1000 datasets confirm
the superiority of InfoSyncNet, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracies of
92.0% and 60.7% Top-1 ACC. The code is available for download (see comments).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在稀疏感知提示下，无法推广到用户隐式期望的语义相关实例，尤其在需要处理密集同质对象（如生物医学核分割）的领域，因此需要弥合这种意图鸿沟。

Method: 引入SAMPO框架，通过偏好优化让视觉基础模型推断高层次的类别意图，而不是传统的像素级微调。

Result: 在稀疏提示下实现了稳健的多目标分割，并在微调期间表现出优秀的数据效率，与当前最好的基线相比，提升了9个百分点以上。

Conclusion: SAMPO方法在三个医学分割任务中达到了最先进的性能，尤其是在像PanNuke-T2这样具有挑战性的任务中，仅用10%的训练数据进行了微调，效果明显优于用全量数据训练的现有方法。

Abstract: Foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in promptable
segmentation but suffer from an intent gap: they segment only explicitly
prompted objects, failing to generalize to semantically related instances
implicitly desired by users. This limitation is critical in domains with dense
homogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual
prompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations
impractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO
(Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that
teaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from
sparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO
optimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through
preference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on
language models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse
prompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning.
Validated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned
with only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing
methods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9
percentage points compared to the best baseline. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual foundation models, removing
dependencies on auxiliary prompt generators or language-model-assisted
preference learning.

TL;DR: HierCore, a novel multi-class image anomaly detection framework, effectively addresses challenges in using class information and demonstrates robust performance under varying conditions, promoting practical applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency in training time and model storage for image anomaly detection by extending models from single-class to multi-class settings, and addressing challenges in detection accuracy and thresholds.

Method: Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore) framework employs a hierarchical memory bank to estimate class-wise decision criteria for anomaly detection, which operates effectively even without class labels.

Result: HierCore exhibits robust performance across four scenarios (with/without class labels during training/evaluation) and meets all requirements for multi-class image anomaly detection.

Conclusion: HierCore consistently meets all defined requirements and maintains strong performance across various settings, demonstrating practical potential for real-world multi-class anomaly detection.

Abstract: Recent advances in image anomaly detection have extended unsupervised
learning-based models from single-class settings to multi-class frameworks,
aiming to improve efficiency in training time and model storage. When a single
model is trained to handle multiple classes, it often underperforms compared to
class-specific models in terms of per-class detection accuracy. Accordingly,
previous studies have primarily focused on narrowing this performance gap.
However, the way class information is used, or not used, remains a relatively
understudied factor that could influence how detection thresholds are defined
in multi-class image anomaly detection. These thresholds, whether
class-specific or class-agnostic, significantly affect detection outcomes. In
this study, we identify and formalize the requirements that a multi-class image
anomaly detection model must satisfy under different conditions, depending on
whether class labels are available during training and evaluation. We then
re-examine existing methods under these criteria. To meet these challenges, we
propose Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a novel framework designed to satisfy
all defined requirements. HierCore operates effectively even without class
labels, leveraging a hierarchical memory bank to estimate class-wise decision
criteria for anomaly detection. We empirically validate the applicability and
robustness of existing methods and HierCore under four distinct scenarios,
determined by the presence or absence of class labels in the training and
evaluation phases. The experimental results demonstrate that HierCore
consistently meets all requirements and maintains strong, stable performance
across all settings, highlighting its practical potential for real-world
multi-class anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$)
is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary
classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content
localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods
are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference
caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive
forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we
present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates
modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal
supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For
modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised
Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the
multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we
propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies
the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from
both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision,
we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It
utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception
from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the
interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FMS compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在多镜头重建保真度方面优于最先进的方法。消融研究证实了fMRI分解和语义字幕的关键作用，其中分解显著改善了解码字幕的CLIP相似性达71.8%。

Conclusion: 这项工作为多镜头fMRI重建建立了一个新范式，通过明确的分解和语义提示实现复杂视觉叙事的准确恢复。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual
cognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current
methods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the
multi-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces
fundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal
resolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and
the lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI
video reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor
module explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments.
(2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual
descriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging
high-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from
existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation
studies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic
captioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP
similarity by 71.8%. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI
reconstruction, enabling accurate recovery of complex visual narratives through
explicit decomposition and semantic prompting.

TL;DR: 该论文提出EFA-GS方法，通过优化低频学习和动态高斯扩展，减少三维重建中的浮动伪影，提高了重建质量和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究三维高斯铺洒中的浮动伪影的起源，以及这些伪影在低质量初始化情况下的影响，从频域的角度分析并解决这个问题，以提高视觉质量和重建的准确性。

Method: 提出一种称为消除浮动伪影高斯铺洒(EFA-GS)的方法，通过选择性地扩展未优化的高斯模型，优先进行准确的低频学习，并结合深度和尺度的策略，动态优化高斯扩展。

Result: 实验显示，EFA-GS方法在减少浮动伪影的同时保持高频细节，在实验中较基准方法在PSNR上提高了1.68 dB。

Conclusion: EFA-GS方法能够有效减少三维重建中的浮动伪影，同时保持高频细节，提升对低频信息的优化，验证了其在下游3D编辑任务中的有效性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful and computationally efficient
representation for 3D reconstruction. Despite its strengths, 3DGS often
produces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the
actual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying
mechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization
scenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the
origins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify
under-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we
propose \textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS),
which selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate
low-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based
and scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion,
effectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating
artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of
1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset. Furthermore, we
validate the effectiveness of our approach in downstream 3D editing tasks. Our
implementation will be released on GitHub.

*Yaofeng Cheng,Xinkai Gao,Sen Zhang,Chao Zeng,Fusheng Zha,Lining Sun,Chenguang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 引入了ReMake框架，通过实例掩码和单目深度估计改善透明物体的深度数据缺失问题，增强了对真实场景的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明物体由于其光学特性，常导致深度摄像机生成不完整或无效的深度数据，进而降低机器人抓取的准确性和可靠性。现有方法通常直接将RGB-D图像输入到网络中以输出完整的深度，期望模型隐式推断深度值的可靠性。然而，这些方法在现实场景中往往难以泛化，因为复杂的光线相互作用导致有效和无效深度数据的分布高度可变。

Method: 提出了一种新的深度补全框架ReMake，该框架由实例掩码和单目深度估计引导。通过明确区分透明区域和非透明区域，掩码使模型能够在训练期间集中学习来自RGB-D输入的这些区域的准确深度估计，从而降低对隐式推理的依赖并改善在现实场景中的泛化能力。另外，单目深度估计为透明物体及其周围环境提供深度背景，提升深度预测准确性。

Result: 大量实验表明，我们的方法在基准数据集和真实场景中均优于现有方法，表现出卓越的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ReMake通过实例掩码和单目深度估计指导了更准确的深度预测，减少了对隐式推理的依赖，同时在基准和现实场景下展现了优越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Due to the optical properties, transparent objects often lead depth cameras
to generate incomplete or invalid depth data, which in turn reduces the
accuracy and reliability of robotic grasping. Existing approaches typically
input the RGB-D image directly into the network to output the complete depth,
expecting the model to implicitly infer the reliability of depth values.
However, while effective in training datasets, such methods often fail to
generalize to real-world scenarios, where complex light interactions lead to
highly variable distributions of valid and invalid depth data. To address this,
we propose ReMake, a novel depth completion framework guided by an instance
mask and monocular depth estimation. By explicitly distinguishing transparent
regions from non-transparent ones, the mask enables the model to concentrate on
learning accurate depth estimation in these areas from RGB-D input during
training. This targeted supervision reduces reliance on implicit reasoning and
improves generalization to real-world scenarios. Additionally, monocular depth
estimation provides depth context between the transparent object and its
surroundings, enhancing depth prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show
that our method outperforms existing approaches on both benchmark datasets and
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization
capability. Code and videos are available at

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型多模态模型在短视频参与度预测中的应用，结果显示模型性能优于当前最先进的基线方法，尤其是音频特征的重要性被强调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着短视频平台上用户生成内容的迅速增加，视频参与度预测对于优化推荐系统和指导内容创作变得越来越重要。然而，此任务具有挑战性，因为它涉及语义内容、视觉质量、音频特征和用户背景等复杂因素的相互作用。

Method: 我们采用两种具有代表性的多模态大模型：VideoLLaMA2和Qwen2.5-VL。前者集成了音频、视觉和语言模态，而后者仅处理视觉和语言模态。通过在SnapUGC数据集上进行训练，这两种模型在与最先进的方法进行比较时表现出色。

Result: 两种模型都表现出了与最先进的基线方法的竞争性表现，其中VideoLLaMA2始终优于Qwen2.5-VL，强调了音频特征在参与度预测中的重要性。

Conclusion: 最终通过融合多种模型，我们的方法在ICCV VQualA 2025 EVQA-SnapUGC挑战赛的短视频参与度预测任务中获得第一名。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of user-generated content (UGC) on short-form video
platforms has made video engagement prediction increasingly important for
optimizing recommendation systems and guiding content creation. However, this
task remains challenging due to the complex interplay of factors such as
semantic content, visual quality, audio characteristics, and user background.
Prior studies have leveraged various types of features from different
modalities, such as visual quality, semantic content, background sound, etc.,
but often struggle to effectively model their cross-feature and cross-modality
interactions. In this work, we empirically investigate the potential of large
multimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction. We adopt two
representative LMMs: VideoLLaMA2, which integrates audio, visual, and language
modalities, and Qwen2.5-VL, which models only visual and language modalities.
Specifically, VideoLLaMA2 jointly processes key video frames, text-based
metadata, and background sound, while Qwen2.5-VL utilizes only key video frames
and text-based metadata. Trained on the SnapUGC dataset, both models
demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines,
showcasing the effectiveness of LMMs in engagement prediction. Notably,
VideoLLaMA2 consistently outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the importance of
audio features in engagement prediction. By ensembling two types of models, our
method achieves first place in the ICCV VQualA 2025 EVQA-SnapUGC Challenge on
short-form video engagement prediction. The code is available at

Motivation: 近年来出现的沥青艺术旨在提高行人能见度和安全性，但其视觉复杂性可能与依赖视觉目标检测模型的监控系统相干扰。

Method: 通过在一个固定的监控场景中合成各种街道艺术图样以构建逼真的人行横道场景，并在良性和对抗性条件下评估模型在沥青艺术人行横道上检测行人的性能。

Result: 结果显示简单的颜色设计影响较小，而复杂的图案，特别是视觉上显著的图案，会显著降低检测性能。此外，恶意制作的沥青艺术能够故意遮蔽行人或生成不存在的行人检测。

Conclusion: 研究表明复杂的艺术图案尤其是视觉上显著的图案会显著降低行人检测性能，同时对抗性设计的沥青艺术可能被恶意利用来故意遮蔽真实行人或产生不存在的行人检测。

Abstract: Artistic crosswalks featuring asphalt art, introduced by different
organizations in recent years, aim to enhance the visibility and safety of
pedestrians. However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance
systems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we
investigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a
pretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic
crosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed
surveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting
pedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial
conditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing
normal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or
altered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while
simple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns,
particularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade
pedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
adversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real
pedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections. These findings
highlight a potential vulnerability in urban vision-based pedestrian
surveillance systems and underscore the importance of accounting for
environmental visual variations when designing robust pedestrian perception
models.

TL;DR: 提出了精度感知视频压缩框架，通过动态调整压缩水平，优化实时交通系统中的视频传输效率，同时提高车辆检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理由于通讯带宽限制导致的实时交通系统应用性能下降问题。

Method: 实现了一种叫做精度感知视频压缩（PAVC）的框架，通过动态调整视频压缩水平来提升车道车辆检测的精度，并减小带宽使用。

Result: PAVC框架在带宽有限的地区可以提升车辆检测精度高达13%，并将通信带宽需求减少至原来需求的8.23倍。在带宽严重受限的地方，PAVC可将带宽需求减少至原来的72倍，并保持车辆检测性能。

Conclusion: 精度感知视频压缩框架能够在不同带宽条件下有效提升车辆检测精度并减少带宽使用，从而支持智能交通系统的可靠运行。

Abstract: Computer vision has become a popular tool in intelligent transportation
systems (ITS), enabling various applications through roadside traffic cameras
that capture video and transmit it in real time to computing devices within the
same network. The efficiency of this video transmission largely depends on the
available bandwidth of the communication system. However, limited bandwidth can
lead to communication bottlenecks, hindering the real-time performance of ITS
applications. To mitigate this issue, lossy video compression techniques can be
used to reduce bandwidth requirements, at the cost of degrading video quality.
This degradation can negatively impact the accuracy of applications that rely
on real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is
influenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions,
suggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response
to these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called
Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera
captures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits
them to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for
safety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment. The
system dynamically adjusts the video compression level based on current weather
and lighting conditions to maintain vehicle detection accuracy while minimizing
bandwidth usage. Our results demonstrate that PAVC improves vehicle detection
accuracy by up to 13% and reduces communication bandwidth requirements by up to
8.23x in areas with moderate bandwidth availability. Moreover, in locations
with severely limited bandwidth, PAVC reduces bandwidth requirements by up to
72x while preserving vehicle detection performance.

TL;DR: MonoDream框架提高了单眼输入在视觉语言导航任务中的表现，通过学习统一导航表示并引入潜在全景梦想任务来监督模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，使用单眼输入进行视觉语言导航（VLN）任务可以降低成本和提高可访问性，但与使用全景RGB-D信息的方法相比仍有差距。

Method: 提出MonoDream，一个轻量级的视觉语言动作（VLA）框架，使得单眼智能体能够学习统一导航表示（UNR），并通过引入潜在全景梦想（LPD）任务来监督该表示。

Result: MonoDream在多个VLN基准测试中显示出一致的改进，并显著缩小了与以全景为基础的代理之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: MonoDream框架通过利用单眼输入进行视觉语义和语言地面动作意图的联合对齐，提升了单眼导航性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks often leverage panoramic RGB and depth
inputs to provide rich spatial cues for action planning, but these sensors can
be costly or less accessible in real-world deployments. Recent approaches based
on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular
input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We
present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to
learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature
representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g.,
global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent,
enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent
Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to
predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current
and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN
benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation
performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.

TL;DR: ReMoMask通过创新的方法克服了文本到动作生成中的挑战，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的文本到动作生成方法面临多样性有限、错误积累和物理不合理等问题。

Method: 提出ReMoMask，一个集成了三项关键创新的统一框架：1）双向动量文本-动作模型；2）语义时空注意机制；3）无类指导的检索增强生成。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上的FID评分分别提高了3.88%和10.97%。

Conclusion: ReMoMask在标准基准测试中表现出色，证明其达到了当前的技术水平。

Abstract: Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. However,
current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion
models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical
implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit
diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To
address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, a unified framework integrating
three key innovations: 1) A Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples
negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially
improving cross-modal retrieval precision; 2) A Semantic Spatio-temporal
Attention mechanism enforces biomechanical constraints during part-level fusion
to eliminate asynchronous artifacts; 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance incorporates
minor unconditional generation to enhance generalization. Built upon MoMask's
RVQ-VAE, ReMoMask efficiently generates temporally coherent motions in minimal
steps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ReMoMask, achieving a 3.88% and 10.97%
improvement in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML, respectively, compared to
the previous SOTA method RAG-T2M. Code:

Result: 发现现有的评估方法存在局限性，并倡导将方差纳入考虑以改善MLLMs的开发。

Conclusion: 当前评估方法的限制，以及提倡意识到方差的方法，以促进MLLMs的更强大和可靠的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
visual question answering (VQA), enabling reasoning and contextual
understanding across visual and textual modalities. Despite their advancements,
the evaluation of MLLMs on VQA benchmarks often relies on point estimates,
overlooking the significant variance in performance caused by factors such as
stochastic model outputs, training seed sensitivity, and hyperparameter
configurations. This paper critically examines these issues by analyzing
variance across 14 widely used VQA benchmarks, covering diverse tasks such as
visual reasoning, text understanding, and commonsense reasoning. We
systematically study the impact of training seed, framework non-determinism,
model scale, and extended instruction finetuning on performance variability.
Additionally, we explore Cloze-style evaluation as an alternate assessment
strategy, studying its effectiveness in reducing stochasticity and improving
reliability across benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of
current evaluation practices and advocate for variance-aware methodologies to
foster more robust and reliable development of MLLMs.

Motivation: 复杂刚性运动的建模在大时空跨度上仍是动态重建中的一个未解决难题，而现有范式主要局限于短期、小规模变形，并在物理一致性上考虑有限。

Method: 该研究提出了PMGS方法，通过3D Gaussian Splatting重建抛物体运动。该工作流程包括两个阶段：1）目标建模，通过动态场景分解和改进的点密度控制实现目标集中的重建；2）运动恢复，通过学习逐帧SE(3)姿态恢复完整的运动序列。

Result: 通过引入加速度一致性约束，连接牛顿力学与姿态估计，并设计动态模拟退火策略，根据运动状态自适应调度学习率。此外，我们设计了一种卡尔曼融合方案，以优化多源观测引起的误差累积并减轻干扰。

Conclusion: 实验表明，相比现有主流动态方法，PMGS在重建高速非线性刚性运动方面表现优越

Abstract: Modeling complex rigid motion across large spatiotemporal spans remains an
unresolved challenge in dynamic reconstruction. Existing paradigms are mainly
confined to short-term, small-scale deformation and offer limited consideration
for physical consistency. This study proposes PMGS, focusing on reconstructing
Projectile Motion via 3D Gaussian Splatting. The workflow comprises two stages:
1) Target Modeling: achieving object-centralized reconstruction through dynamic
scene decomposition and an improved point density control; 2) Motion Recovery:
restoring full motion sequences by learning per-frame SE(3) poses. We introduce
an acceleration consistency constraint to bridge Newtonian mechanics and pose
estimation, and design a dynamic simulated annealing strategy that adaptively
schedules learning rates based on motion states. Futhermore, we devise a Kalman
fusion scheme to optimize error accumulation from multi-source observations to
mitigate disturbances. Experiments show PMGS's superior performance in
reconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion compared to mainstream dynamic
methods.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一套简单而强大的基准模型MedVLThinker，通过开源的方法实现了在医学领域的推理模型。使用我们的方法训练的模型在公开的VQA基准上达到了新的最先进水平。我们的方法推动了医学领域多模态推理模型的研究。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by
enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building
reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and
comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet
strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data
curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to
varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms:
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness.
Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six
medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly
outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key,
counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning
data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal
image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on
text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA
benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore,
scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary
GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community
with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical
reasoning.

Result: AugPT提高了模型性能和泛化能力，并且进行了大量实验验证。

Conclusion: AugPT增强模型性能和泛化能力，不需要外部知识。

Abstract: For CLIP-based prompt tuning, introducing more data as additional knowledge
for enhancing fine-tuning process is proved to be an effective approach.
Existing data amplification strategies for prompt tuning typically rely on
external knowledge (e.g., large language models or pre-structured knowledge
bases), resulting in higher costs for data collection and processing, while
generally ignoring further utilization of features in image modality. To
address this, we propose Augmentation-driven Prompt Tuning (AugPT), a
self-contained distillation-based prompt tuning approach using only internal
augmentation on raw dataset to better exploit known features. Specifically,
AugPT employs self-supervised augmentation on unlabeled images in the training
set, and introduces a novel gating mechanism based on consensus test, reusing
the pre-trained prompt tuning backbone model to spontaneously filter noisy
samples, further enhancing the quality of augmented views. Extensive
experiments validate that AugPT simultaneously enhances model performance and
generalization capability without using appended external knowledge. The code
of AugPT is available at: https://github.com/JREion/AugPT .

*Sara Yavari,Rahul Nitin Pandya,Jacob Furst*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督两阶段的框架提高脑肿瘤分割的效果，方法无需地面真实标签且在BraTS 2021数据集上取得优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI扫描中脑肿瘤的准确分割对于临床诊断和治疗计划至关重要。因此，我们提出了一种无需地面真实掩码的半监督方法，以提高在BraTS 2021数据集上的分割性能。

Method: 我们提出了一个半监督的两阶段框架。第一阶段采用残差指导的去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）进行跨模态合成，通过从FLAIR、T1和T2扫描重构T1ce模态来实现。残差图，捕捉预测和实际T1ce图像之间的差异，作为空间先验以增强下游分割。在第二阶段，轻量级U-Net将残差图（实际T1ce和合成T1ce之间的差异）与T1、T2和FLAIR模态连接输入，以提高整体肿瘤分割。

Result: 我们的方法通过切片级过滤来排除无信息样本，并优化阈值策略以平衡精度和召回率，成功提高了整体肿瘤分割的表现。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在BraTS 2021数据集中的整体肿瘤分割上达到了93.02%的Dice分数和86.7%的IoU，超越了BraTS 2020的数据集上的ReCoSeg基线（Dice: 91.7%，IoU: 85.3%），表现出更高的准确性和可扩展性，适用于现实世界的多中心MRI数据集。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is critical for clinical
diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose a semi-supervised, two-stage
framework that extends the ReCoSeg approach to the larger and more
heterogeneous BraTS 2021 dataset, while eliminating the need for ground-truth
masks for the segmentation objective. In the first stage, a residual-guided
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) performs cross-modal synthesis
by reconstructing the T1ce modality from FLAIR, T1, and T2 scans. The residual
maps, capturing differences between predicted and actual T1ce images, serve as
spatial priors to enhance downstream segmentation. In the second stage, a
lightweight U-Net takes as input the concatenation of residual maps, computed
as the difference between real T1ce and synthesized T1ce, with T1, T2, and
FLAIR modalities to improve whole tumor segmentation. To address the increased
scale and variability of BraTS 2021, we apply slice-level filtering to exclude
non-informative samples and optimize thresholding strategies to balance
precision and recall. Our method achieves a Dice score of $93.02\%$ and an IoU
of $86.7\%$ for whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2021 dataset,
outperforming the ReCoSeg baseline on BraTS 2020 (Dice: $91.7\%$, IoU:
$85.3\%$), and demonstrating improved accuracy and scalability for real-world,
multi-center MRI datasets.

Abstract: In clinical practice, medical image analysis often requires efficient
execution on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, existing mobile
models-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical
tasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and
medical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical
imaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing
lightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we
propose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)
tailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly
purposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a
parameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This
design exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being
lighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we
introduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively
balances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of
medical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer
bottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with
downsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced
computational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves
state-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering
diverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen
datasets. These results establish it as an efficient yet powerful and
generalization solution for mobile medical image analysis. Code is available at
