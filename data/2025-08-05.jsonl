To address these challenges, we\npropose Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter that enables diffusion-based\ninpainting models to process transparent images directly. Trans-Adapter also\nsupports controllable editing via ControlNet and can be seamlessly integrated\ninto various community models.

When integrated with standard BP,\nENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image\nclassification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations\ngeneralize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval.\nFurthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient,\nbackpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\\ell$. This variant\nnot only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\\times$\ntraining speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy\nof end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm\nthat directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to\nenhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training\nregime."}

To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided\nTransformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of\nthe current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and\ndependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns\npredefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using\ntransformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead.

This limitation has led to efforts to generate images\nconditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work\nmodifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated\nimages by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.\nThis enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,\ngenerally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two\ncommon issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate\nimages that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches\nneglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.\nSpecifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired\nconditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve\nthis, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired\nconditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image\nprompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention\nmodifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image\nand alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and\nvalues from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the\ngenerated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new\nself-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys\nand values from both images rather than selecting between them.

Specifically, we introduce three novel algorithms: (1) SPMC (Spherical\nPattern Matching by Correlation), (2) FRS (Fast Rotation Search), and (3) a\nhybrid approach (SPMC+FRS) that combines the advantages of the previous two\nmethods. Our experiments demonstrate that in the $\\mathbb{S}^2$ domain and in\ncorrespondence-free settings, our algorithms are over 10x faster and over 10x\nmore accurate than current state-of-the-art methods for the Wahba problem with\noutliers. We validate our approach through extensive simulations on a new\ndataset of spherical patterns, the ``Robust Vector Alignment Dataset.\n\"Furthermore, we adapt our methods to two real-world tasks: (i) Point Cloud\nRegistration (PCR) and (ii) rotation estimation for spherical images."}

Despite its strengths, 3DGS often\nproduces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the\nactual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying\nmechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization\nscenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the\norigins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify\nunder-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we\npropose \\textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS),\nwhich selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate\nlow-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based\nand scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion,\neffectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic\nand real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating\nartifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of\n1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset.

Existing approaches typically\ninput the RGB-D image directly into the network to output the complete depth,\nexpecting the model to implicitly infer the reliability of depth values.\nHowever, while effective in training datasets, such methods often fail to\ngeneralize to real-world scenarios, where complex light interactions lead to\nhighly variable distributions of valid and invalid depth data. To address this,\nwe propose ReMake, a novel depth completion framework guided by an instance\nmask and monocular depth estimation. By explicitly distinguishing transparent\nregions from non-transparent ones, the mask enables the model to concentrate on\nlearning accurate depth estimation in these areas from RGB-D input during\ntraining. This targeted supervision reduces reliance on implicit reasoning and\nimproves generalization to real-world scenarios. Additionally, monocular depth\nestimation provides depth context between the transparent object and its\nsurroundings, enhancing depth prediction accuracy.

In this work, we empirically investigate the potential of large\nmultimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction. We adopt two\nrepresentative LMMs: VideoLLaMA2, which integrates audio, visual, and language\nmodalities, and Qwen2.5-VL, which models only visual and language modalities.\nSpecifically, VideoLLaMA2 jointly processes key video frames, text-based\nmetadata, and background sound, while Qwen2.5-VL utilizes only key video frames\nand text-based metadata.

The efficiency of this video transmission largely depends on the\navailable bandwidth of the communication system. However, limited bandwidth can\nlead to communication bottlenecks, hindering the real-time performance of ITS\napplications. To mitigate this issue, lossy video compression techniques can be\nused to reduce bandwidth requirements, at the cost of degrading video quality.\nThis degradation can negatively impact the accuracy of applications that rely\non real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is\ninfluenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions,\nsuggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response\nto these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called\nPrecision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera\ncaptures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits\nthem to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for\nsafety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment. The\nsystem dynamically adjusts the video compression level based on current weather\nand lighting conditions to maintain vehicle detection accuracy while minimizing\nbandwidth usage. Our results demonstrate that PAVC improves vehicle detection\naccuracy by up to 13% and reduces communication bandwidth requirements by up to\n8.23x in areas with moderate bandwidth availability.
