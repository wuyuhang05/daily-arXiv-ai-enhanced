Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark, EGE-Math Solutions Assessment
Benchmark, for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on their ability to
assess hand-written mathematical solutions. Unlike existing benchmarks that
focus on problem solving, our approach centres on understanding student
solutions, identifying mistakes, and assigning grades according to fixed
criteria. We compile 122 scanned solutions from the Russian Unified State Exam
(EGE) together with official expert grades, and evaluate seven modern VLMs from
Google, OpenAI, Arcee AI, and Alibaba Cloud in three inference modes. The
results reveal current limitations in mathematical reasoning and human-rubric
alignment, opening new research avenues in AI-assisted assessment. You can find

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for fast and robust reconstruction of urban-scale scenes with improved efficiency and quality, featuring scene partitioning, an adaptive LOD strategy, and enhancement modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable fast reconstruction and real-time rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance variations across multi-view captures.

Method: We introduce a framework that includes scene partitioning for parallel training with a visibility-based image selection strategy, a controllable level-of-detail strategy, and enhancement modules such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing for improving reconstruction fidelity.

Result: The experimental results show that our method improves both the efficiency and quality of urban-scale scene reconstruction compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: Our method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous approaches in both efficiency and quality.

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

### [3] [Modeling Human Gaze Behavior with Diffusion Models for Unified Scanpath Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23021)
*Giuseppe Cartella,Vittorio Cuculo,Alessandro D'Amelio,Marcella Cornia,Giuseppe Boccignone,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScanDiff结合扩散模型和视觉变换器，生成多样且真实的注视路径，优于现有方法并推动了凝视预测领域的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解视觉注意力对人机交互、自动驾驶系统和认知机器人非常重要，而现有的方法无法很好地捕捉人类视觉探索的多样性。

Method: 提出了一种新的架构ScanDiff，结合扩散模型与视觉变换器，生成多样且真实的注视路径，并通过文本条件实现任务驱动的注视路径生成。

Result: ScanDiff在基准数据集上的实验结果超越了现有方法，能够在自由观看和任务驱动场景中生成更具多样性和准确性的注视路径。

Conclusion: ScanDiff能够更好地捕捉人类视觉行为的复杂性，推动了凝视预测研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

### [4] [Recovering Diagnostic Value: Super-Resolution-Aided Echocardiographic Classification in Resource-Constrained Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23027)
*Krishan Agyakari Raja Babu,Om Prabhu,Annu,Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用深度学习超分辨率模型改善低质量心脏超声图像的分类精度，在资源有限环境下的 AI 辅助医疗中展现出潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源有限的环境中，心脏超声图像质量低下，限制诊断模型的有效性。尽管超分辨率技术在增强 MRI 和 CT 扫描上表现出色，但在噪声较多的超声领域的应用仍然有限。因此，我们研究深度学习超分辨率技术在改善心脏超声图像分类精度方面的潜力。

Method: 我们使用深度学习超分辨率模型 SRGAN 和 SRResNet 对低质量的 2D 心脏超声图像进行增强，采用公共的 CAMUS 数据集进行图像质量的分级和分类任务的评估。

Result: 应用 SRGAN 和 SRResNet 增强低质量图像，特别是 SRResNet 不仅提高了性能指标，还具有计算效率。超分辨率技术能有效恢复退化超声扫描中的诊断价值。

Conclusion: 深度学习超分辨率技术可以有效地提高低质量心脏超声图像的分类准确性，用于资源有限环境的AI辅助医疗。

Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is
often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the
effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR)
techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely
accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification
accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS
dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically
relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs.
Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole
vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR
models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and
Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images
and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet,
which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR
can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a
viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

### [5] [Adaptive Time-step Training for Enhancing Spike-Based Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23033)
*Ranxi Lin,Canming Yao,Jiayi Li,Weihang Liu,Xin Lou,Pingqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PATA是一种基于脉冲尖峰神经网络的NeRF框架，利用动态时间步长策略实现了在保持渲染质量的前提下减少推理时间和功耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在神经渲染中，由于场景的规模和纹理复杂性的内在变化，以及为每个场景单独训练模型的惯例，现有模型在训练和推理过程中依赖多视角下沿射线进行密集点采样，导致浮点运算激增，限制了在资源受限场景中的使用。

Method: 提出了一种基于神经辐射场（NeRF）的脉冲尖峰神经网络（SNN）框架，采用动态时间步长训练策略，称为预训练自适应时间步长调整（PATA）。

Result: PATA能够在保持渲染保真度的同时，显著减少推理时间步长和运行功耗，具体为减少64%的时间步长并降低61.55%的功耗。

Conclusion: PATA可以在保持渲染质量的前提下，将推理时间步长减少64%并降低运行功耗61.55%。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

### [6] [Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NovaDrive提高自动驾驶成功率，减少碰撞，并优化路径效率，具有更低的能耗和扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速响应复杂道路和交通情况，提高自动驾驶车辆的导航能力，降低燃料或电池消耗。

Method: 使用单分支视觉-语言架构，处理前置摄像头图像、高清地图瓦片、LiDAR深度和文本航点；采用轻量级、两阶段交叉注意力块进行数据对齐和注意力细化；使用平滑损失函数以避免突然的方向和速度变化，并进行Vision-Language模型的精调。

Result: 在nuScenes和Waymo的MD-NEX户外基准测试子集上，成功率提高到84%，路径效率提高到0.66，碰撞频率减少到1.2%。

Conclusion: NovaDrive显著提高了自动驾驶的成功率和路径效率，减少了碰撞频率，同时实现了更短的路线和较低的燃料或电池使用。其设计可扩展到其他具身人工智能领域。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road
geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce
NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes
front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a
single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns
waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image
and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt
steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent
memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language
backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the
MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts
path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from
2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations
confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention
fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's
shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower
fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving
stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

### [7] [Reference-Guided Diffusion Inpainting For Multimodal Counterfactual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23058)
*Alexandru Buburuzan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MObI和AnydoorMed两个革新性方法，用于自动驾驶和医疗图像合成数据生成，通过扩散模型实现真实感和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据方法因收集真实数据的成本和复杂性而越来越受到关注。但这些方法必须非常逼真且可控才能有效。该研究旨在通过创新的方法解决此问题。

Method: 文章介绍了MObI和AnydoorMed两种方法：MObI使用多模式对象填充框架，采用扩散模型完成跨感知模式的填充；AnydoorMed将此范式扩展到医学成像领域，通过参考引导填充乳房X光扫描异常。

Result: MObI方法可在保持语义一致性和多模式一致性的同时将对象插入现有多模态场景中，AnydoorMed可通过扩散模型准确填充乳腺X光图像中的异常，并保持细节和结构完整。

Conclusion: 该研究介绍了两种新的合成数据生成方法，分别用于自动驾驶和医学图像分析领域。这些方法表现出基础模型在自然图像参考引导填充上可以适应不同感知模式，并推动下一代系统能够构建高度逼真、可控的多模式反事实场景。

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

### [8] [Vision-Language Fusion for Real-Time Autonomous Driving: Goal-Centered Cross-Attention of Camera, HD-Map, & Waypoints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23064)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan,Murari Ambati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZ-Drive是一种结合视觉与语言模型的单一系统，通过早期、标记级的融合，提高了自主驾驶的准确性与透明度，在基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了实现自主车的精准几何和语义理解，提出了一种将视觉和语言模型相结合，以提高自主驾驶的效率和安全性。

Method: 使用轻量级目标中心交叉注意层，让途径点标记突出相关图像和地图片段，然后将融合后的标记输入部分微调的LLaMA-3.2 11B模型。

Result: XYZ-Drive在MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving基准测试中达到了95%的成功率和0.80 SPL，较PhysNav-DG提高了15%，并减少了碰撞率，实现了高度的效率提升。

Conclusion: XYZ-Drive通过引入轻量级目标中心交叉注意层和部分微调的LLaMA-3.2模型，实现了自主驾驶的准确性和透明度。在MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving基准测试中显示出色表现，与PhysNav-DG相比提升了成功率，并减少了碰撞。各个模块之间的互补性和连接性通过消融实验得到验证。

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

### [9] [Vocabulary-free Fine-grained Visual Recognition via Enriched Contextually Grounded Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23070)
*Dmitry Demidov,Zaigham Zaheer,Omkar Thawakar,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-FineR 方法在细粒度图像分类中无需训练即可取得先进的结果，在零样本和小样本分类中性能出色，并不依赖预定义的类标签，具备可扩展性和通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的细粒度图像分类方法受到固定词汇和封闭集分类范式的限制，尤其是在无法预定义类标签的新领域中。通过结合大语言模型（LLM）和视觉语言模型（VLM），可以实现无需要预定义类标签的开放集识别，但现有方法在利用LLM的分类能力方面存在局限。

Method: 我们提出了一种名为 E-FineR 的无训练方法，可以在开放集识别中取得先进水平的结果。该方法不依赖于固定的词汇表或人类提供的类名，而是实现了灵活的基于语言理解的分类。

Result: 我们的 E-FineR 方法在无训练条件下，实现了与现有最先进技术持平的分类性能，且无需进行人为干预。此外，它在提供可解释性和适应性方面展示了巨大潜力，特别是在专家批注难以获得的新领域。

Conclusion: 我们的 E-FineR 方法在细粒度视觉识别方面表现出色，并在零样本和小样本分类中达到现有技术的同等水平，同时无需训练和人工干预。这表明该方法在真实世界场景中具有很强的潜力和适应能力。

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is
available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

### [10] [Details Matter for Indoor Open-vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23134)
*Sanghun Jung,Jingjing Zheng,Ke Zhang,Nan Qiao,Albert Y. C. Chen,Lu Xia,Chi Liu,Yuyin Sun,Xiao Zeng,Hsiang-Wei Huang,Byron Boots,Min Sun,Cheng-Hao Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过结合多种概念并引入Alpha-CLIP和SMS评分，提出了一种开放词汇3D实例分割的新方法，在多个数据集上取得了领先的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇表的3D实例分割（OV-3DIS）需要一种新的方法来结合各种概念，以有效生成3D实例建议并准确分类。

Method: 该论文提出了一种新的两阶段方案，包括3D建议生成和实例分类。引入了基于Alpha-CLIP的分类方法，并使用标准化最大相似度（SMS）评分来提高精度。

Result: 在ScanNet200和S3DIS数据集上，我们的框架在所有AP和AR指标上都实现了最新的性能，甚至超越了一些端到端的封闭词汇法。

Conclusion: 本研究通过精心设计的策略将多个概念结合起来，提出了一种有效的开放词汇3D实例分割解决方案。

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify
them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we
observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but
complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D
tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove
overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the
classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which
incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and
obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the
standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal
similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS
across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary
method.

*Xiaochen Zhao,Hongyi Xu,Guoxian Song,You Xie,Chenxu Zhang,Xiu Li,Linjie Luo,Jinli Suo,Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-NeMo是一种新的零样本扩散肖像动画管道，通过驱动视频中的面部动作动画静态肖像，解决了身份泄露问题，并超越了现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在身份泄露和难以捕捉细微及极端表情的问题。本研究的动机是解决这些关键问题，提出一个能够更好动画静态肖像画的系统。

Method: X-NeMo使用一个端到端的训练框架，从驱动图片中提取一个一维的与身份无关的潜在运动描述符，通过图像生成时的交叉注意力来有效控制运动。通过使用双重GAN解码器，以及空间和颜色增强，进一步提高表现力并将运动潜在变量与身份提示分离。

Result: 经过广泛的实验证明，X-NeMo在表现力和身份相似性上均超过了最新的基线，实现了更高表现力的动画。

Conclusion: X-NeMo能够在无预训练运动检测器的情况下，从多样化的视频数据集中学习，同时使用双重GAN解码器进行监督学习，大幅减少了身份泄露，并在面部表情动画方面已经超过了最新进展的基线。而我们的代码和模型也已经可用于学术研究。

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation
pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving
video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of
the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in
capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D
identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively
controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our
implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,
learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained
motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion
latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN
decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving
motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention
rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission
of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion
backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly
expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models
are available for research.

### [12] [Neural Multi-View Self-Calibrated Photometric Stereo without Photometric Stereo Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23162)
*Xu Cao,Takafumi Taketomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 引入了一种神经逆渲染的方法，可以同时重建几何、反射率和光照，比现有方法表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服现有多视图光度立体方法必须进行光照校准或利用中间线索的限制，使得所有场景参数可以从原始图像中在单一阶段共同优化。

Method: 使用神经逆渲染方法，将几何、空间可变反射率和光照条件共同重建为神经隐式场，并应用了阴影感知体积渲染。一个空间网络首先预测每个场景点的有符号距离和反射率潜在代码，而一个反射率网络则基于潜在代码、角编码的表面法线、视图和光照方向来估计反射率值。

Result: 提出的方法在形状和光照估计的精度方面优于当前的先进方法，能够处理具有挑战性的几何和反射率的对象，并推广到视图不对齐的多光图片像。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法优于现有的基于法线的形状和光照估计方法，其在处理具有复杂几何和反射特性的物体时表现更佳，并能够推广到未对齐视图的多光照图像。

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs
geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from
multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior
multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or
intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes
all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both
geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware
volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a
reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then
estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly
encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting
estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and
handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

Result: 在Rain100L数据集上实现了33.29 dB的PSNR，在Rain100H数据集上实现了26.16 dB的PSNR，明显优于之前的方法。

Conclusion: 通过使用Corner Loss和引入R-CBAM块，该研究提出的方法能够比之前的方法更有效地去除单图像中的雨条痕迹，并且在Rain100L和Rain100H数据集上取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: The problem of single-image rain streak removal goes beyond simple noise
suppression, requiring the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details
and overall visual quality. In this study, we propose a novel image restoration
network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a
Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture
information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual
Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and
decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and
channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions
heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the
Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on
Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.

TL;DR: 该框架引入音频实现四模态对齐，通过序列级对比学习增强了运动检索性能，提升用户体验和获取精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏直观和用户友好的交互模式，同时常常忽视模态的序列表征。因此，我们提出通过细粒度联合嵌入空间对齐四种模态以增强用户沉浸感和便利性。

Method: 采用序列级对比学习方法，以捕捉跨模态的关键细节实现细粒度嵌入空间。

Result: 在多个子任务上优于现有最新方法，如在HumanML3D数据集的文本到运动检索R@10提高10.16%，视频到运动检索R@1提高25.43%。

Conclusion: 引入音频后，多模态运动检索显著提高了文本到运动、视频到运动等任务的表现。

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%
improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in
R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our
results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal
counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for
advancing motion acquisition.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel dataset for segmenting flooded areas in
satellite images. After reviewing 77 existing benchmarks utilizing satellite
imagery, we identified a shortage of suitable datasets for this specific task.
To fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA
floods from Planet Explorer by Planet Labs (Image \c{opyright} 2024 Planet Labs
PBC). The dataset consists of 10 satellite images per location, each containing
both flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the
five states: Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The dataset
ensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating
semantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in
computer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted
an ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.
Overall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for
future multimodal and temporal learning strategies. The dataset will be

TL;DR: 本文提出的AGD方法能生成有效的对抗图像以误导MLLMs，同时表现出对防御方法的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过生成对抗图像来误导多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），而又保持图像的质量不受显著影响。

Method: 提出了一种对抗指导扩散（AGD）的方法，将目标语义注入到逆向扩散的噪声组件中，通过注入对抗指导噪声来保证攻击效果。

Result: 实验证明，AGD在攻击性能和对某些防御方法的模型鲁棒性方面优于最新的技术。

Conclusion: AGD方法在对抗攻击中表现出色，在对抗图像生成方面具有显著优势。其生成的对抗图像在对抗模型防御时更加鲁棒。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合分类和分割模型的方法，提高了晶体团聚现象分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D显微图像中团聚现象由于水的透明性和图像视角的限制，人工注释难度较大。

Method: 提出了一种监督学习的基线模型生成伪标签，然后训练了一个实例分类模型，同时进行像素级分割，推断阶段结合两者各自优点。设计并加入了保留晶体特性的后处理模块。

Result: 在两种人工注释置信水平下进行评估，成功分类出了潜在团聚实例。

Conclusion: 实验方法较现有方法提高了晶体团聚分类的准确性和尺寸分布预测能力。

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

*Zicheng Lin,Weichao Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出YOLO-ROC模型，通过增强多尺度特征提取和减少计算复杂度，提高了道路损伤检测的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习检测方法在处理不同目标类型（如裂缝和坑洼）时的多尺度特征提取能力不足，以及主流模型的高参数量及计算需求限制了其在实际应用中快速检测的部署。

Method: 设计了一种双向多尺度空间金字塔池化快速模块（BMS-SPPF），增强了多尺度特征提取；实现了层次化通道压缩策略，降低了计算复杂度。

Result: 实验结果表明，YOLO-ROC在RDD2022_China_Drone数据集上实现了67.6%的mAP50，超过了基准模型YOLOv8n；在小目标D40类别上的mAP50提高了16.8%，模型大小仅为2.0 MB；在RDD2022_China_Motorbike数据集上表现出出色的泛化性能。

Conclusion: YOLO-ROC在多尺度特征提取和参数压缩方面取得了显著进展，实现了高精度和轻量化的道路损伤检测。

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

Abstract: As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life,
ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of its virtual content is critical. Our
research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that
which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We
developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using
vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on
this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually
aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks;
and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR
devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned
framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual
modeling, multimodal AR content implementation, and lightweight model
adaptation.

TL;DR: 重新定义了半监督Few-Shot类增量学习的场景并提出了ALDC策略，有效利用无标签样本解决基础类与新类的辨识难题，实验性能优秀。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的半监督Few-Shot 类增量学习假设无标签数据源仅限于当前会话的新类，这是一个狭隘的视角，不符合实际。因此，重新定义为全局半监督FSCIL，这是更贴近现实的场景。

Method: 提出了模棱两可指导的可学习分布校准（ALDC）策略。ALDC利用丰富的基础样本动态校正少样本新类的偏置特征分布。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，提出的方法优于现有工作，设定了新的最先进效果。

Conclusion: 通过设计的ALDC策略，有效地解决了在新的通用半监督FSCIL定义下，如何利用无标签样本更好地区分基础类与新类的问题，并在实验中取得了先进的性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an
Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC
dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions
for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that
our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 解决RAG系统中优化查询以访问外部知识的挑战，特别是在不同的非结构化文档场景中。

Method: 提出了一种名为RL-QR的强化学习框架，使用合成场景-问题对和广义奖励政策优化（GRPO）来训练适用于特定检索器的查询重写器。

Result: 对于多模态RAG，RL-QR多模态实现了11%的NDCG@3相对增益；对于词汇检索器，RL-QR词汇实现了9%的增益。然而，在语义和混合检索器上，由于训练不匹配，未能改善性能。

Conclusion: RL-QR在RAG系统的查询优化中具有潜力，提供了一个可扩展、无注释的数据解决方案，但在语义检索方面仍需进一步改进。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

Motivation: 脑神经在人体大脑的各种重要功能中起着关键作用，而从扩散MRI映射它们的路径提供了术前关于脑神经与关键组织空间关系的宝贵见解。然而，由于每对脑神经独特的解剖结构以及颅底环境的复杂性，全面详细的脑神经图谱具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过促进多对脑神经路径的更高效和自动化映射，增强了对复杂脑结构的分析和理解。

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed
CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN
pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present
what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion
tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The
CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by
multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable
clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for
multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50
subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual
experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence
with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP
dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of
pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8
fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,
oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear
nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work
contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient
and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing
the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through
visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based
approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few
existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single
category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper
presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of
representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from
multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,
highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven
by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数值度量指标如均方误差（MSE）无法评估时间序列数据的几何结构，这对于理解时间动态至关重要。

Method: 提出了时间序列几何结构指数（TGSI），将时间序列转化为图像以利用其二维几何表示，进一步引入了形状感知时间损失（SATL），一种多组件损失函数，包括一阶差分损失、频域损失和感知特征损失。

Result: 实验表明，使用SATL训练的模型在MSE和所提TGSI指标上均优于基线方法，且推理时无额外计算成本。

Conclusion: SATL可以在保持计算成本不变的情况下提高结构建模，增强模型性能。

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

Motivation: 传统方法的预设阈值忽略了不同类别的分数分布差异，导致伪标签不准确和不完整，从而影响性能。

Method: 提出了语义感知阈值学习（SATL）算法，通过动态更新各类别的分数分布及确定特定的阈值，结合差异排名损失函数以增强类别区分。

Result: 在Microsoft COCO和VG-200等大规模多标签数据集上的实验分析表明，该方法显著提高了有限标签场景下的识别性能。

Conclusion: 引入的SATL算法在有限标签情况下显著提高了多标签图像识别的性能。

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to
train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely
on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified
labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

Motivation: Address the accumulated errors and decoding artifacts introduced by the two-stage training paradigm of using pre-trained VAE in diffusion transformers.

Method: Modeling patch-wise decoding with neural field to achieve end-to-end pixel space processing.

Result: PixelNerd achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet 256x256 and 2.84 FID on ImageNet 512x512 without complex pipelines. In text-to-image tasks, it scored 0.73 on GenEval benchmark and 80.9 on DPG benchmark.

Conclusion: PixelNerd provides a single-scale, single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution for diffusion transformers, avoiding complex cascade pipelines and accumulated errors from VAE.

Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the
compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE).
However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated
errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems,
researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines
and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to
model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,
single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field
diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in
PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID
on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also
extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16
achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9
overall score on the DPG benchmark.

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

*Gyeongjin Kang,Seungtae Nam,Xiangyu Sun,Sameh Khamis,Abdelrahman Mohamed,Eunbyung Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iLRM offers superior scalable feed-forward 3D reconstruction with better quality and speed, utilizing iterative refinement of 3D Gaussian representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods suffer from scalability issues due to their dependence on full attention across multiple image tokens, which becomes computationally expensive as the number of views or resolution increases.

Method: This paper introduces iLRM, which generates 3D Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism guided by decoupling scene representation from input-view images, decomposing fully-attentional multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme, and injecting high-resolution information at every layer.

Result: iLRM achieves superior scalability and delivers higher reconstruction quality under comparable computational costs, leveraging a larger number of input views efficiently.

Conclusion: iLRM in this paper provides a scalable solution for feed-forward 3D reconstruction, significantly improving reconstruction quality and speed compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and
high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D
representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant
attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous
applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger
number of input views.

TL;DR: UniLIP扩展了CLIP功能，通过新的训练和结构策略，提升其在生成和编辑任务中的表现，超越了以往同类模型的基准成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决以往CLIP-based方法在重建和生成任务中不一致或性能下降的问题，提升在这些任务中的表现。

Method: 提出了一个两阶段训练方案和自我蒸馏策略，将重构能力逐步整合到CLIP中，并采用了双条件架构与MLLM和扩散变换器连接。

Result: 在文本到图像生成任务中，UniLIP在GenEval和WISE基准上的得分分别为0.87和0.53，超过了所有以前的同等规模的统一模型。在图像编辑方面，UniLIP在ImgEdit基准上的得分为3.62，超越了最近的先进模型如BAGEL和UniWorld-V1。

Conclusion: UniLIP成功扩展了CLIP的应用范围，使其不仅在理解任务中表现出色，还在生成和编辑任务中具有高度竞争力的表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

TL;DR: 提出BLiM和CPN的新框架，有效减轻候选项先验偏差，提高文本-视频检索相关性，在四个基准上超越当前最优模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多模态大语言模型的简单应用引入了候选项的先验偏差，提高了内在先验较高的候选项概率，影响了查询相关性，因此需要新的框架来改善这一点。

Method: 提出了双向可能性估计框架BLiM，训练模型生成从给定视频到文本和从给定文本到视频特征的转换，同时引入CPN模块，以减轻候选项先验偏差。

Result: BLiM与CPN在文本-视频检索任务中的平均提升了6.4的R@1分数，展现了CPN在减少文本先验效果中的能力，提升了视觉理解。

Conclusion: BLiM结合CPN在四个文本-视频检索基准上平均提高了6.4 的R@1分数，成功减轻了候选项先验偏差，强调了查询和候选项的相关性，并展示了CPN在提升视觉理解中的广泛适用性。

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

TL;DR: 提出了新的评估基准LED以解决现有评估方法无法检测的文档布局预测中的结构性错误，并通过实验揭示了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于当前的评估标准不足以检测文档布局预测中的结构性错误，需要一种新的评估基准来解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出一种新的基准Layout Error Detection (LED)，用于评估文档布局预测的结构鲁棒性，并定义了八种标准化错误类型以及三个互补任务：错误存在检测、错误类型分类和元素级错误类型分类。此外构建了一个合成数据集LED-Dataset，通过基于DLA模型的经验分布注入现实的结构错误。

Result: 实验结果表明，在多种大语言模型和多模态模型中，LED能够有效地区分结构理解能力，并揭示传统指标无法发现的模式偏好和性能权衡。

Conclusion: LED能有效区分模型的结构理解能力，揭示传统指标无法察觉的模式偏好和性能权衡。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models
and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However,
despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural
errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional
evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap,
are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we
propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight
standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error
existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type
classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset
generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical
distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs
reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding
capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible
through traditional metrics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解耦方法FreeFine，用于几何图像编辑，在新的基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何图像编辑是一项挑战性任务，涉及在保持整体场景一致性的情况下重新定位、重新定向或重塑图像中的对象。现有基于扩散的方法在处理大规模或结构复杂的转换时效果不佳。

Method: 本文提出了一种解耦的流水线，分离对象变换、源区域修复和目标区域细化。修复和细化采用一种无需训练的扩散方法——FreeFine。

Result: 在新的GeoBench基准测试中，FreeFine在图像保真度和编辑精度方面优于最新的替代方案，尤其是在要求较高的转换场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法通过分离不同编辑任务有效解决了几何图像编辑中的复杂变换挑战，提升了编辑质量。

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an
image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene
coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all
relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations
become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled
pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and
target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using
a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new
GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit
precision, especially under demanding transformations. Code and benchmark are

TL;DR: ST-SAM通过自训练策略和单网络架构，在仅用1%标注数据下实现领先性能，解决了现有方法的预测偏差和计算开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的半监督伪装目标检测方法在稀少监督下存在预测偏差和错误传播问题，多网络架构带来高计算开销。本文提出一种能够高效利用标注且简洁的框架ST-SAM来克服上述局限性。

Method: ST-SAM采用自训练策略，通过动态过滤和扩展高置信度的伪标签，增强单模型架构，转化伪标签为包含领域特定知识的混合提示，充分利用Segment Anything Model在特定任务上的潜力。

Result: 实验表明，ST-SAM在COD基准数据集上超越了现有SSCOD方法，即便只使用了1%的标注数据，其性能与完全监督方法相匹配。

Conclusion: ST-SAM框架在仅使用1%标注数据的情况下实现了最新性能，且匹配了完全监督方法，同时只需训练一个网络，无需依赖特定模型或损失函数。

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance
on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and
abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific
knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential
for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.
Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or
loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient
SSCOD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/hu-xh/ST-SAM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在没有高清地图支持的环境中，自主车辆需独立感知周围环境，然而现有方法对道路元素的结构化先验利用不足导致预测不准确。

Method: 提出PriorFusion框架，整合语义、几何和生成先验，通过形状先验指导的实例注意机制和数据驱动的形状模板空间进行感知优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，PriorFusion提高了复杂条件下的感知精度，生成的道路元素预测更加准确、规则和一致。

Conclusion: PriorFusion大幅提高了路面元素的感知精度，尤其是在复杂环境下。

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管传统计算机视觉假设内容和风格是正交的，但扩散模型在培训期间没有关于这种区别的明确指导，这引发了对这些模型如何内部表示诸如内容和风格等概念的探究。

Method: 利用交叉注意力热图将生成图像中的像素归因于特定的提示词，从而能够分离出由描述内容和风格的词影响的图像区域。

Result: 研究表明，扩散模型在处理不同的艺术提示和风格请求时表现出内容和风格分离的不同程度，内容提示词主要影响物体相关区域，而风格提示词更多影响背景和纹理区域。这表明模型在无显式监督情况下对内容和风格区分具备一定的内在理解。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了变换器基础的文本到图像扩散模型在生成艺术作品时展现的内容和风格分离的不同程度，并揭示该分离依赖于特定的艺术提示词和风格请求。这些发现有助于理解大规模生成模型在没有显式监督的情况下内部表示复杂艺术概念的方式。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention
maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for
real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as
embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of
hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT
v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,
regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for
real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter
count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge
deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and
adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,
while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%
Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling
balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results
give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning
models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines. All code and

TL;DR: FastDriveVLA improves autonomous driving model efficiency by pruning visual tokens, focusing on foreground information, and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the computational costs of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models while maintaining effective decision-making, especially in autonomous driving systems, where existing token pruning methods perform poorly.

Method: The paper proposes FastDriveVLA, which includes a visual token pruner called ReconPruner. ReconPruner utilizes MAE-style pixel reconstruction and a novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy to prioritize foreground information. Once trained, it can be applied to different VLA models without retraining. A new dataset, nuScenes-FG, was introduced to support this training.

Result: FastDriveVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark under various pruning ratios.

Conclusion: FastDriveVLA achieves superior performance in autonomous driving scenarios by prioritizing foreground information for decision-making.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的车道拓扑推理方法在利用时间信息方面表现不足，特别是在应对历史查询的过度依赖、姿态估计失败的脆弱性和时间传播不足方面存在限制。因此需要一种新方法来优化推理表现。

Method: 该研究提出了一种称为FASTopoWM的新型快慢车道段拓扑推理框架，其中结合了潜在世界模型进行推理。为了降低姿态估计失败的影响，该框架同时监督历史和新初始化的查询，实现快慢系统间的相互增强。此外，引入了基于动作潜在的查询和BEV世界模型，以从过去的观察中传播状态表示到当前时间步。

Result: 在OpenLane-V2基准测试中，FASTopoWM在车道段检测(mAP提升至37.4%，对比基于现有方法的33.6%)和中央线感知(OLS提升至46.3%，对比现有方法的41.5%)上均超越了最先进的方法。

Conclusion: FASTopoWM通过使用潜在世界模型有效解决了现有方法在利用时间信息时的不足，提供了更稳定更准确的车道段检测和推理能力。

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

TL;DR: 提出了一种域泛化框架，通过特征扰动和一致性约束提高医学图像分割在未见领域的鲁棒性，实验表明效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割在临床工作流程中起着关键作用，但域移位会导致模型在未见过的临床领域表现退化。为了应对这种挑战，需要提高模型在不同成像条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 我们提出了一种针对医学图像分割的域泛化框架。该方法通过引入由域统计指导的隐式特征扰动来提高对特定域变化的鲁棒性。具体来说，我们使用可学习的语义方向选择器和基于协方差的语义强度采样器，以调制域变异特征，同时保持任务相关的解剖一致性。

Result: 在两个公共多中心基准上的广泛实验表明，我们的框架在不同的临床领域中始终优于现有的域泛化方法，表现出稳健和可泛化的分割性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架比现有的域泛化方法更具优势，能够实现跨不同临床领域的稳健和可泛化的分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving
perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and
driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种稳健的路面重建框架，通过引入二维高斯曲面和语义引导的颜色增强技术，有效应对动态遮挡和环境变化问题，大幅提升了重建的视觉和几何质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 路面重建对自动驾驶至关重要，有助于实现复杂城市环境中的厘米级车道感知和高清制图。目前基于网格渲染或3D高斯点技术的方法在干净静态条件下取得了有希望的结果，但它们对动态代理的遮挡、静态障碍的视觉杂乱以及光照和天气变化导致的外观退化仍然很脆弱。

Method: 引入了一个稳健的重建框架，集成了考虑遮挡的二维高斯曲面和语义引导的颜色增强技术。该方法利用平面适应的高斯表示以有效进行大规模建模，并通过分割引导的视频修复技术移除动态和静态前景物体，通过在HSV空间进行语义感知校正提升颜色一致性。

Result: 在城市尺度的数据集上的大量实验表明，我们的框架在视觉一致性和几何忠实度方面的重建效果显著优于现有方法，尤其是在真实世界条件下。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的稳健重建框架有效解决了自动驾驶中的路面重建难题，通过提升模型在动态障碍物遮挡和环境变化中生成的一致性和准确性，显著优于之前的方法。

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting
centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex
urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions,
they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from
static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather
changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates
occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to
recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted
Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs
segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static
foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction
in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that
our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful
reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world
conditions.

Method: 使用WIDER FACE数据集，评估三种深度学习模型（YOLOv11、YOLOv12和MTCNN）在不同图像分辨率（160x160, 320x320, 640x640）下的性能表现。

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Motivation: 在快速发展的文本到图像(T2I)模型背景下，人工智能生成的说话人AGTH逐渐成为新兴的数字人媒体。然而，这些说话人和AGTH的生成质量面临挑战，且关于这些问题的全面研究尚有限。

Method: 提出了迄今为止最大的AGTH质量评估数据集THQA-10K，选择了12个突出的T2I模型和14个先进的说话人来生成AGTHs，并招募志愿者对生成的AGTH进行主观评分。此外，提出了一种基于首帧、Y-T切片和音色-唇形一致性的客观质量评估方法。

Conclusion: 该研究有效填补了AGTH质量评估的研究空白，并推出了可用于评估和改进AGTH生成质量的工具和方法。

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers"
because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial
movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)
models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging
digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

Conclusion: 该报告分析了计算机视觉中关键设计模式的演变，涵盖了从图像识别的基础架构到生成模型以及自监督学习技术的发展。所研究的方法显示出计算机视觉领域内不同模型在处理大规模数据集时的独特优势和最新进展。

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

Motivation: 大规模视图语言模型应用受限于模型参数庞大和计算成本高，分层剪枝在NLP中已证明有效，有必要探索其在LVLM中的应用。

Method: 通过大量实验，分析视图语言（VL）标记和层间特征差异，对传统分层剪枝方法的有效性进行了验证并提出新的框架。

Result: Short-LVLM框架实现了性能和效率的更好平衡，具有训练自由、模型不可知和高度兼容的潜在优势。

Conclusion: 传统的分层剪枝方法对大规模视图语言模型（LVLM）无效，提出的Short-LVLM框架克服了这些挑战并取得优势。

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of Transformer's attention mechanism in learning-based feature matching methods and improve efficiency while maintaining performance.

Method: VMatcher employs a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network, integrating Mamba's Selective State-Space Model with Transformer's attention mechanism, providing multiple configurations including hierarchical architectures.

Result: VMatcher achieves comparable or superior performance with significant efficiency gains compared to existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in semi-dense feature matching tasks.

Conclusion: VMatcher sets new benchmarks efficiently and is robust and practical for real-time applications due to its rapid inference capabilities.

Abstract: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for
semi-dense feature matching between image pairs. Learning-based feature
matching methods, whether detector-based or detector-free, achieve
state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention
mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its
quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space
Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear
complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid
approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with
the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are
proposed, including hierarchical architectures, demonstrating their
effectiveness in setting new benchmarks efficiently while ensuring robustness
and practicality for real-time applications where rapid inference is crucial.

Motivation: 情感理解和生成往往被视为独立任务，但实际它们是互补且可以相互增强的。本文旨在通过统一这两项任务，提高模型在情感相关应用中的表现。

Method: 本文提出的UniEmo系统通过层次情感理解链和可学习的专家查询，逐步提取多尺度情感特征，并利用这些特征来指导情感生成过程。此外，引入情感相关系数和情感条件损失来增强生成图像的多样性和保真度。最后，使用一种新颖的数据过滤算法选择高质量的情感图像，以增强理解模块。

Result: 通过联合训练，UniEmo模型在情感理解和生成任务中的表现显著优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: UniEmo系统通过统一情感理解和生成任务，显著提升了模型的情感理解能力，并在这些任务上优于现有的先进方法。

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained
model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these
generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding
capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

Motivation: 解决在多源场景中直接使用CLIP模型进行域适应时对齐稳定性差的问题，尤其是噪声样本带来的困难。

Method: 提出逐步对齐策略，从高置信度目标样本开始训练，然后逐渐引入更具挑战性的样本，以减轻初始标签噪声的影响。

Result: MP^2A在ImageCLEF、Office-Home和DomainNet三个UDA基准上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MP^2A有效地缓解了确认偏差，促进了更稳健的收敛，成功学习域不变特征。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: NeRF-GS结合NeRF和3DGS架构，在3D场景表示方面取得了领先性能，证明这两者是互补而非竞争的。

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework
leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene
representation.

Result: 在公共和私人数据集上的大量实验表明，AGA方法在图像-文本检索和分类任务中取得了较强的性能表现。

Conclusion: AGA框架能有效捕捉医疗图像和报告中的结构化语义，并在图像-文本检索和分类任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

Result: SBDDM在多个接近非分布和远离非分布基准上实现了卓越性能，优化了计算成本，并提高了检测准确率。

Conclusion: SBDDM通过减少计算成本和提高准确性，为实时可靠的计算机辅助诊断提供了实用基础。

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

Motivation: 现有的分类框架存在局部化聚焦和线性投影层的限制，难以模型全球组合上下文及复杂风格特征间的互动。因此，我们希望通过改进的框架解决这一问题，提高分类准确率。

Method: 本文提出了一种增强的双教师知识蒸馏框架，通过用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)替代传统的MLP投影和预测头。KANs使用样条为基础的激活函数，以精确数学模型处理非线性特征关联，保留了对局部纹理与笔触和整体风格层次的互补指导。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的方法在WikiArt和Pandora18k数据集上的Top-1准确率优于基础双教师架构。

Conclusion: 我们的研究表明，在艺术风格分类问题中，使用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) 对复杂风格的解构具有显著优势，比传统的MLP投影方法能提供更高的线性探测准确率。

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational
aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate,
often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher
self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear
projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional
context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher
knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing
conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher
networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other
capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based
activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical
precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings
highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds,
leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

TL;DR: 为了改进HSI的压缩，提出了一种新的可调节压缩网络模型HyCASS，通过实验验证了其优越性，并开放了代码和预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要对光谱和空间压缩对HSI压缩的单独和联合影响进行深入分析，以了解光谱、空间和联合空谱冗余对HSI压缩的影响。

Method: 提出了一种基于学习的网络模型，包含六个主要模块：光谱编码器、空间编码器、压缩比适配编码器、压缩比适配解码器、空间解码器和光谱解码器模块。利用卷积层和Transformer块来捕获短程和长程冗余。

Conclusion: 提出了HyCASS网络，该网络在光谱和空间维度上进行可调节的HSI压缩，实验结果表明其优于现有模型。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS),
the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant
attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However,
a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral
and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been
thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for
understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint
spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we
propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network
(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in
both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)
spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter
encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder
module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to
capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on
two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based
on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and
spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial
resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

Motivation: 通过机器学习识别数据中的复杂关系，提高问题解决精度，具体考虑使用胸部X光图像预测患者病情。

Method: 使用两种机器学习算法：基线卷积神经网络（CNN）和DenseNet-121，对5824张胸部X光图像进行分析并进行预测。

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of
research in which data is used to train algorithms, learn patterns, and make

significant accuracy without explicit programming by recognizing complex

implement two machine learning algorithms, namely, a baseline convolutional

machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline
CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem
presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that
DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray
images in its decision-making more than the baseline CNN.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法RAF，通过知识蒸馏解决联邦学习中分辨率漂移的问题，提升了非分类任务的人体姿态估计性能，并具有广泛适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前联邦学习在非分类任务上的应用仍然不足，特别是在不同客户端存在分辨率变化的情况下，性能下降显著，因此需要解决这一关键问题，即分辨率漂移。

Method: 提出了一种利用基于热图的知识蒸馏的分辨率自适应联邦学习方法（RAF），通过在更高分辨率输出（教师）和较低分辨率输出（学生）之间进行多分辨率的知识蒸馏，提升分辨率鲁棒性。

Result: 通过广泛的实验和理论分析，方法有效缓解了分辨率漂移现象，实现了显著的性能提升，并可以无缝集成到现有的FL框架中。

Conclusion: 提出了分辨率自适应联邦学习（RAF），通过热图知识蒸馏增强人类姿态估计任务中的分辨率鲁棒性，解决了分辨率漂移问题，并展示其对其他高分辨率表示任务的广泛适用性。

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across
distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has
primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication
efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.
However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose
estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a
critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades
significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level
heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as
another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To
address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a
method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through
multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs
(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances
resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and
theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates
resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also
can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although
this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals
distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution
representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks
that rely on preserving spatial detail.

TL;DR: CST Anti-UAV是一个新设计的热红外数据集，针对微小无人机的复杂场景跟踪，支持详细的属性注释，然而，现有方法在该集上的表现仍然不理想。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机跟踪数据集缺乏场景复杂性和属性表现的多样性，限制了其在实际场景中的适用性。

Method: 评估了20种现有的单一目标跟踪方法在CST Anti-UAV数据集上的性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，在复杂环境中跟踪微小无人机仍然具有挑战性，最先进的方法仅实现了35.92%的状态精度，远低于在Anti-UAV410数据集上观察到的67.69%。

Conclusion: CST Anti-UAV基准的发布将推动更健壮的单一目标跟踪方法的开发，并促进反无人机系统的创新。

Abstract: The widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised
serious public safety and privacy concerns, making UAV perception crucial for
anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature
conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute
representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared
dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex
Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k
high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a
significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex
scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to
incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise
evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance
analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex
environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only
35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410
dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and
the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV
benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the
development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV
systems.

Motivation: 现有3D VLMs在健壮性推理和泛化方面存在困难，原因在于空间数据质量不足和视点假设的静态性。

Method: 构建高质量合成数据集Scene-30K，使用RLHF策略在强化学习训练过程中增强推理能力，引入动态视角选择策略。

Result: 3D-R1在各种3D场景基准测试中平均提高了10%的性能。

Conclusion: 3D-R1模型显著提升了3D场景理解中的推理和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D
visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities
to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust
reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data
and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we
propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of
3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with
CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine
based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1.
Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning
training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward
functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format
reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.
Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively
chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%
across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing
reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding. Code:

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating
the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent
challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge
devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation
by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy
consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging
due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the
overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that
combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the
gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small
intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we
consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the
feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first
multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating
established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series
analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a
significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves
an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on
the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters
while surpassing the current baselines.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized 3D point cloud processing, yet
efficiently handling large and irregular point clouds remains challenging. To
tackle this problem, we introduce FastPoint, a novel software-based

curve, we can efficiently identify subsequent sample points without
exhaustively computing all pairwise distances. Our proposal substantially
accelerates farthest point sampling and neighbor search operations while

Conclusion: 使用Stable-Sim2Real方法模拟的3D数据与真实数据具有高度相似性，并能显著提高真实世界3D视觉任务中的性能。

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured
3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D
data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to
capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning
an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,
but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work
explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called
Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial
stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and
synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local
regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the
synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where
diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a
3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data
simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with
the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances
performance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation
demonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and
real-captured patterns. Project page:

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field
conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations.
This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep
learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The
method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and
tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A
polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass.
Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated
strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask
inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area
ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU)
scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical
limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated
harvesting and yield monitoring with complex occlusion patterns.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于非欧几里得空间的图像配准方法Hy-CycleAlign，用于改善多源数据融合中的配准精度，显示出比现有方法更优的对齐和融合效果。

Abstract: Image fusion synthesizes complementary information from multiple sources,
mitigating the inherent limitations of unimodal imaging systems. Accurate image
registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However,
existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean
space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in
suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we
explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle
Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign
is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces
a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward
registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration
network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration
structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic
Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into
hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing
interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image
registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that
hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image
registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

Motivation: 模型选择在机器学习的图像分类领域越来越重要，因为存在多种架构和大小的分类器。当前对这些模型工作原理的理解有限，因此需要了解模型决策过程。

Method: 利用最小充分像素集分析模型的‘集中度’，这些像素集能从模型的视角捕获图像的本质。通过比较像素集的位置、重叠和大小，进行不同架构间的集中度分析。

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing
field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different
architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more
important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our
understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order
to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we
propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's
`concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the
lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,
we identify that different architectures have statistically different
concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA
models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are
misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct
classifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VRD模型在关系检测数据上训练时，难以推广到超出训练关系范围的场景。而手工提示语在处理新颖或复杂关系时表现不佳。因此，作者认为通过在多样化的指令数据上微调视觉语言模型，可以更有效地解决这一问题。

Method: 引入ART（一种自适应关系调整框架），通过将VRD数据集转化为指令调优格式并采用自适应采样算法，使视觉语言模型在保持通用性的同时，专注于信息丰富的关系。

Result: 应用ART框架后的模型在多个复杂性不同的测试集上表现显著优于基线模型，且能够推断出主流VRD方法缺乏的未见关系概念。

Conclusion: 本文提出的ART框架通过指令调优和策略性示例选择，提高了视觉关系检测任务中模型的概括能力，能够在复杂场景下进行有效的关系分类。

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships
between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection
data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.
While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for
VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.
We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by
fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an
Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction
tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an
instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART
directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining
generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where
subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between
them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets
of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and
can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD
methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations
for segmenting complex scenes.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as
robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where
the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object
categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments
and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this
paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and
introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).
We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed
3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D

Conclusion: 提出的Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs)模型在多种真实数据集上实现了隐私和非隐私视觉定位的最先进性能。

Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a camera pose in a known
environment. In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based
representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We
propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for
visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an
implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and
differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature
representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware
feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a
contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we
further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the
features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual
localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or
segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene
representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and
non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world
datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

TL;DR: BeyondGloss框架利用视频大语言模型和对比对齐实现了无词汇手语翻译，并在多个基准上达到了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语翻译需要跨越视觉与语言信息的模态差异，并捕捉手势及动作的细微变化。这项任务具有相当大的挑战性。

Method: 本文提出了一个新的无词汇手语翻译框架，称为BeyondGloss，利用视频大语言模型（VideoLLMs）的时空推理能力。通过创新的生成细粒度、时间感知的手部动作文本描述方法，并用对比对齐模块与视频特征对齐。同时，蒸馏来自HaMeR的细粒度特征，以丰富手部特定的表示。还应用了一种对比损失，以减少预训练时的模态差异。

Conclusion: BeyondGloss框架显著改善了手语翻译任务的性能，通过引入多种新颖技术，有效解决了模态差异问题，并实现了对手部动作的精细捕捉。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging
the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing
subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages
the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models
(VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail,
we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual
descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these
descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to
focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively.
To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained
features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign
video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap
in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

TL;DR: MamV2XCalib是一种利用车载LiDAR的V2X基础设施摄像头校准方法，无需特定参考物或人工介入，实验表明其在现实数据集上的表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着利用路边摄像头辅助自动驾驶车辆感知的协作系统越来越普及，大规模精确的基础设施摄像头校准成为一个关键问题。传统的手动校准方法往往耗时费力，并可能需要封路。

Method: 引入了一种新的无目标物LiDAR-相机校准方法，将多尺度特征与4D相关体积相结合，以估计车载点云与路边图像之间的相关性。通过Mamba建模时间信息并估计旋转角度，解决了V2X场景中由于车辆数据缺陷（如遮挡）和视点差异大而导致的校准失败。

Result: 在现实数据集上的实验显示，MamV2XCalib方法改进了V2X场景中的校准性能，减少了参数需求。

Conclusion: MamV2XCalib在V2X-Seq和TUMTraf-V2X现实数据集上的评估表明，该方法在自动校准方面有效且稳健。与之前为单车校准设计的LiDAR-相机方法相比，该方法在V2X场景中实现了更好和更稳定的校准性能，并且参数更少。

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous
vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise
calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional
manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may
require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based
infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side
LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to
drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need
for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new
targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features
and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side
point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and
estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration
failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as
occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the
V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to
previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach
achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with
fewer parameters. The code is available at

TL;DR: MoGA方法可从单视图图像重建高保真的3D高斯头像，通过生成头像模型和2D视图合成相结合，解决了不一致和伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的单视图重建方法通常依赖于2D扩散模型，这会导致生成的视图稀疏且不一致，从而产生不现实的3D伪影和模糊的外观。

Method: 我们提出了一种新的生成头像模型，它通过学习到的先验分布对变形高斯采样，生成多样的3D头像。我们将其作为先验，将输入图像投射到潜在空间，并增加3D外观和几何约束。

Result: 实验表明，我们的方法超越了现有的技术水平，并且在现实场景中具有良好的泛化能力。我们的高斯头像本质上是可动画的。

Conclusion: MoGA方法通过结合生成头像的建模和2D模型合成的视图，实现了3D高保真头像的重建，并在实验中表现优越。

Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian
avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen
appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.
Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;
however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in
unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,
we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by
sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the
limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all
image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,
ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and
enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel
approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by
fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The
generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting,
enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments
show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well
to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种高效准确的3D占用预测方法，通过方向性纯2D方法，同时保证了精度和计算效率，具有重要的应用前景。

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring
the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current
methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To
address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a
directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to
preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for
the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby
maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a
directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from
different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our
approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method
achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively
balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the
inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's
applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出Vcamba方法，结合频率和空间特征进行视频伪装目标检测，在两个数据集上超过了当前先进方法并降低了计算成本。

Motivation: 现有视频伪装目标检测方法主要依赖空间外观特征，但由于伪装下前景与背景的高度相似性，这限制了检测准确性和完整性。频率特征可以增强特征表示，补偿外观局限并感知运动，Mamba模型提高了长序列建模能力。因此，提出融合频率和空间特征的Vcamba方法。

Method: 提出了Vcamba方法，结合了频率和空间特征进行高效和准确的视频伪装目标检测。引入了RFVSS模块进行多尺度空间特征提取，AFE模块进行频率学习，SLMP和FLMP模块用于建模时空序列和频率时序序列，SFMF模块整合双域特征进行统一运动表示。

Conclusion: Vcamba超过了现有的最先进方法，在两个数据集上的六个评估指标中表现更好，并且计算成本更低，证实了其优越性。

Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on
spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage.
However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results
in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and
texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies
demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation
to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through
dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space
model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame
sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on
spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial
features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive
field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features
after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive
frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain
sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose
a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based
long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and
frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally,
the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain
features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our
Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2
datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去除受保护健康信息（PHI）和个人身份信息（PII）是共享医学图像的基本要求，以确保符合患者隐私法律，同时需要保持非PHI元数据以支持成像人工智能的发展。

Method: MIDI-B挑战分为三个阶段：训练、验证和测试，参与者使用各种开源和专有工具，定制配置、大型语言模型和光学字符识别（OCR）。

Result: 在测试阶段完成的十个团队中，得分从97.91%到99.93%不等，显示了规则导向方法在图像去身份化中的成功。

Conclusion: MIDI-B挑战提供了一个标准化平台，用于基于符合HIPAA安全港法规、DICOM属性保密配置文件和保持研究关键元数据的最佳实践来评估DICOM图像去身份化工具。

Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and
personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for
sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure
compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI
metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial
intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The
goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM
image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor
regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in
preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and
multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic
PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and
test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase,
we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or
public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images
containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten
teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure
success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the
percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The
scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of
open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large
language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we
provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design,
implementation, results, and lessons learned.

*Yucheng Xie,Fu Feng,Ruixiao Shi,Jing Wang,Yong Rui,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DivControl is a new framework for image generation that improves generalization and reduces training costs by disentangling components and using dynamic knowledge routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current I2I generation methods suffer from poor generalization and high adaptation costs for novel conditions. A more adaptable and efficient approach is needed to improve performance and scalability.

Method: DivControl uses a decomposable pretraining framework that factorizes ControlNet through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), resulting in disentangled components. It employs knowledge diversion and a dynamic gate to enable zero-shot generalization and efficient adaptation.

Result: DivControl provides strong zero-shot and few-shot performance with 36.4 times less training cost, enhancing condition fidelity and training efficiency, and demonstrates superior scalability, modularity, and transferability.

Conclusion: DivControl achieves state-of-the-art controllability and significantly reduces training cost, while enhancing performance on both seen and unseen conditions.

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image
(I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps,
enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train
separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with
entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation
costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable
pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient
adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic
components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into
condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge
diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented
via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the
semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and
parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve
condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation
alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art
controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously
improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong
zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior
scalability, modularity, and transferability.

Motivation: 现有的SOTA在多个任务中表现出色，但在处理小型对象时表现欠佳。为了克服这一点，提出了EMAT。

Method: EMAT引入了三项改进：一种新的内存高效掩码注意力机制、一种可学习的降尺度策略以及参数效率的增强。

Result: EMAT显著提升了分类和分割的准确性，特别是在处理小型对象时。还建立了两种新的评估设置以更好地反映实际情况。

Conclusion: EMAT在PASCAL-5i和COCO-20i数据集上表现优于所有现有FS-CS方法，同时使用的可训练参数至少减少四倍。

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly
performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few
annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we
propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves
classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT
introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention
mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency
enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and
COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.
Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available
annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation
settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

Motivation: 尖峰神经网络（SNNs）因其生物合理性和能够实现高能效的神经形态计算而备受关注。然而，对于SNNs而言，其非微可分性使得高效训练成为一大挑战。现有的梯度近似方法常常在牺牲准确性和面临边缘设备部署限制的情况下进行。而本研究的动机是针对这些挑战提出一种无需梯度近似且能显著降低计算复杂性的训练框架。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train
SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient
approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment
limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements
of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward
(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural
Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby
eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing
computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity
adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on
inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network
resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and
75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively,
surpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed
method exhibits significant advantages in terms of memory access and
computational power consumption.

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and
labor-intensive labeling, significantly limiting the performance and
generalization of segmentation models. While mask-controllable diffusion models
excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We
propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework
that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation.
Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image
pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in
parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on
lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used,
enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations

Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a
critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying
temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require
fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation
horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we
systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We
first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when
transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the
temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit
conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.
Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model
pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that
explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve
state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by
over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj
achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA,
WorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available:

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical
imaging, yet encounters significant challenges due to data limitations and
hardware variations. We introduce SAMSA, a novel interactive segmentation
framework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA
efficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral
similarity computations. The method addresses key limitations in HSI
segmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates
independently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on
publicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a
neurosurgical and 81.1% 1-click and 89.2% 5-click DICE on an intraoperative

different spectral characteristics, providing a flexible framework for
hyperspectral medical image analysis.

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving
systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which
is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data
from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate
photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating
driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel
method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with
Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and
rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt
the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the
range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which
also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure
the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information
to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a
multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views.
To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving
datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results
demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle
view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%,
34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.

TL;DR: FlowGaussian-VR通过流驱动速度场建模改进了3D视频重建，对复杂运动场景表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的3D高斯视频重建方法在处理复杂运动和尺度变化时表现不佳，因此需要改进模型以提升视觉质量。

Method: 提出了一种称为FlowGaussian-VR的流程驱动速度场建模方案，包括速度场渲染（VFR）管线和流辅助自适应加密策略（FAD）。

Result: 在多视图动态重建和新视角合成任务中，FlowGaussian-VR模型在不同现实世界数据集上展示了显著的视觉改进，PSNR提高超过2.5 dB，并减少了动态纹理的模糊伪影。

Conclusion: FlowGaussian-VR改进了动态场景的视频重建质量，特别是在处理复杂运动及显著尺度变化时表现出色。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time
rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has
achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great
representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with
complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often
overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual
quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for
static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic
content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity
field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed
FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering
(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a
flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and
size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on
multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple
real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not
only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry
artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian
trajectories.

Motivation: 在术中使用机器学习模型进行组织表征有助于决策并指导安全的肿瘤切除。然而，深度学习模型过于自信的预测会导致像素归属方法过于自信。因此，需要一种结合风险估算的像素归属方法来改善图像分类的可解释性。

Method: 提出一种结合风险估计的像素归属方法，通过反复应用分类模型和像素归属方法来创建一个PA（像素归属）图卷，并首次生成一个像素级别的PA值分布。然后通过估算像素级别的期望值来生成一个增强的PA图，同时利用变异系数估算这张增强PA图的像素级风险。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅提供了一个改进的PA图，还对输出PA值的风险进行了估计，提高了图像分类模型的可解释性。

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue
characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections.
For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer
explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions
translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose
the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution
method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method
iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to
create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate
a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an
enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise
distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to
estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method
not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on
the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser
Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved
explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving
non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine
the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven
learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods
in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and
still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for
functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the
accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios
where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the
first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can
be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative
model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative
modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit
the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth
functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the
learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used
strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of
functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation
strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate
that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic
approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching. Our code is available at:

Abstract: General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance
perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions.
However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based
large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about
open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale
grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like
instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k
reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as
wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully
annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions
is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing
functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a
VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that
conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on
affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that
our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code

Motivation: 解决当前OCL中槽重复利用导致的信息丢失和段错误问题，并利用内在信息进行更全面的监督信号。

Method: 使用Slot Attention与重新初始化和自蒸馏（DIAS）相结合的方法，减少聚合槽的冗余，并进行自蒸馏以优化聚合过程。

Result: 实验表明，DIAS在对象发现和识别等OCL任务中达到了最前沿的表现，并在高级视觉预测和推理上有所改进。

Conclusion: DIAS在对象发现和识别等OCL任务上达到了最先进的水平，并改善了高级视觉预测和推理。

Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning
(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,
termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.
OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying
competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the
query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing
redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This
often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,
mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into
the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal
information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with
re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce
redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to
update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the
first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to
enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves
state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also
improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on

Conclusion: SeqSplatNet方法在SeqAffordSplat基准测试上表现出色，能够从单步交互扩展到复杂的场景级别的顺序任务。

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the
functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited
to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of
addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale
benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance
understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an
end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D
affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that
autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional
Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete
affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a
robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design
a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision
Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art
on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from
single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

Result: 实现了无学习要求的实时物理模拟，能够通用于任何身体形状和运动，并消除了运动与物体动态不真实的问题。

Conclusion: 新的方法解决了现有模型的物理交互缺陷，实现了无穿插的物理互动。

Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently
represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically
interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result,
kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as
interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable
of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we
propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a
physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent
SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and
objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics.
Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex
training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body
shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves
the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating
physical interactions

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents

grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to
mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure
of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as
related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end
grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging
benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from
being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable
consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of

Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves

Motivation: 现有的多视图重建方法需要大量的校准摄像机，构建代价高且难以捕捉自然场景。

Method: 通过对每个摄像机的单目重建进行独立对齐，从而生成时间和视图一致的动态场景重建。

Result: 在PanopticStudio和Ego-Exo4D数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法的重建质量优于现有方法，特别是在生成新视图方面。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法能从稀疏视图的视频中重建动态场景，并且在生成新视图时比先前的方法获得更高质量的重建结果。

Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view
videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of
calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are
prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.
In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a
bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene
coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that
dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view
setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,
we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to
produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive
experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method
achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when
rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on

correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel
benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models,

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that
creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D
diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and
the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and
motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS
Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and
their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,
and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.
Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation
Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on
input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D
objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation
quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable
generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on
synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

TL;DR: PancreasDG 是一个新的大规模胰腺分割数据集，为医学成像中的领域泛化研究提供了数据支持，提出的半监督方法显著提高了分割准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补当前公共跨域基准测试中对胰腺的忽视，尽管胰腺在早期癌症检测、手术和糖尿病研究中具有重要的临床意义。

Method: 提出了一种半监督方法，利用解剖不变性，显著提升了跨序列分割中Dice得分的表现。

Result: 通过 PancreasDG 数据集的跨中心和跨序列变异性的研究，揭示三点：(i) 限制的采样会引入显著方差，可能误认为是分布转移；(ii) 跨中心性能与相同序列的源域性能相关；(iii) 跨序列变化需要专业化的解决方案。

Conclusion: PancreasDG 提出了一个新基准，大幅度提高了跨序列分割领域的Dice得分，并且显著优于现有的领域泛化技术。

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at
https://pancreasdg.netlify.app.

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet
differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges
for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can
help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled
images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous
satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this
work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat
Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a
reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap
between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat
imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing
applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of
heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key
considerations for future advancements in the field.
