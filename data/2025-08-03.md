Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark, EGE-Math Solutions Assessment
Benchmark, for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on their ability to
assess hand-written mathematical solutions. Unlike existing benchmarks that
focus on problem solving, our approach centres on understanding student
solutions, identifying mistakes, and assigning grades according to fixed
criteria. We compile 122 scanned solutions from the Russian Unified State Exam
(EGE) together with official expert grades, and evaluate seven modern VLMs from
Google, OpenAI, Arcee AI, and Alibaba Cloud in three inference modes. The
results reveal current limitations in mathematical reasoning and human-rubric
alignment, opening new research avenues in AI-assisted assessment. You can find

*Zhensheng Yuan,Haozhi Huang,Zhen Xiong,Di Wang,Guanghua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种框架，能够快速重建和实时渲染城市规模场景，同时保持对外观变化的鲁棒性。实验结果显示，该方法在效率和质量上均优于以往的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们的框架的设计旨在实现快速重建和实时渲染城市规模场景，同时在多视角捕捉过程中保持对外观变化的鲁棒性。

Method: 我们的框架从场景分割开始，以实现并行训练，采用了一种基于可见性的图像选择策略来优化训练效率。可控的细节层次(LOD)策略在用户定义的预算下明确调节高斯密度，实现高效的训练和渲染，同时保持较高的视觉保真度。还利用了增强模块，如深度正则化、比例正则化和抗锯齿，以提高重建的保真度。

Result: 我们的方法能够有效地重建城市规模的场景，并在效率和质量上超越了先前的方法。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，我们的方法能够有效地重建城市规模的场景，并在效率和质量上优于以往的方法。

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

### [3] [Modeling Human Gaze Behavior with Diffusion Models for Unified Scanpath Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23021)
*Giuseppe Cartella,Vittorio Cuculo,Alessandro D'Amelio,Marcella Cornia,Giuseppe Boccignone,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScanDiff uses diffusion models and Vision Transformers to generate variable and accurate human gaze scanpaths, outperforming current methods and offering adaptability for different tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems, and cognitive robotics, but existing models fail to capture the variability of human visual exploration.

Method: The paper presents ScanDiff, which combines diffusion models with Vision Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. It models scanpath variability through the stochastic nature of diffusion models and introduces textual conditioning for task-driven scanpath generation.

Result: ScanDiff is able to produce a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories and adapts to different visual search objectives, demonstrating better performance than existing methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and accurate scanpaths.

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

### [4] [Recovering Diagnostic Value: Super-Resolution-Aided Echocardiographic Classification in Resource-Constrained Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23027)
*Krishan Agyakari Raja Babu,Om Prabhu,Annu,Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在资源受限环境中，通过深度学习超级分辨率技术提高低质量超声心动图的诊断能力，特别是SRResNet模型在计算效率和性能提升上表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的环境中，超声心动图图像质量差限制了后续诊断模型的有效性，因而探索超级分辨率技术在提高超声心动图图像质量上的应用潜力，旨在提升其诊断价值。

Method: 应用两种常用的超级分辨率模型：超级分辨率生成对抗网络（SRGAN）和超级分辨率残差网络（SRResNet）来增强低质量图像，然后在其上进行2CH vs. 4CH视图分类以及ED vs. ES阶段分类任务。

Result: 通过使用SRResNet模型，观察到在性能指标上取得显著提升，SR可以有效地恢复降级的超声心动图扫描的诊断价值。

Conclusion: 使用深度学习驱动的超级分辨率技术可以提高低质量二维超声心动图的分类准确性，尤其是对于资源受限的环境中的AI辅助护理具有重要潜在价值。

Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is
often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the
effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR)
techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely
accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification
accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS
dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically
relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs.
Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole
vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR
models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and
Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images
and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet,
which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR
can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a
viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

### [5] [Adaptive Time-step Training for Enhancing Spike-Based Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23033)
*Ranxi Lin,Canming Yao,Jiayi Li,Weihang Liu,Xin Lou,Pingqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种基于尖峰神经网络的NeRF框架和动态时间步训练策略，通过自动权衡渲染质量与时间步长，减少推理时间步长和运行功耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF模型在3D重建和渲染任务上取得显著成功，但在训练和推理期间依赖于密集点采样，导致浮点操作增加，限制了其在资源受限场景中的应用。SNNs具有能量效率高的优势，因此被提出作为一种替代方案。

Method: 提出一种动态时间步长训练策略，称为预训练-自适应时间步长调整(PATA)，用于在训练期间自动探索渲染质量与时间步长之间的权衡。

Result: 实验结果表明，PATA可以在保持渲染保真度的同时，将推理时间步长减少64%并将运行功耗减少61.55%。

Conclusion: 通过将SNNs和动态时间步训练策略应用于NeRF框架，能够在不牺牲渲染质量的情况下显著降低推理步骤和计算资源的消耗。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

### [6] [Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NovaDrive通过单分支视觉语言架构提高自动驾驶的成功率、安全性和效率，并降低了能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要在复杂环境中快速做出反应并理解道路几何和交通意图，因此需要一种高效处理多模态信息的架构。

Method: 提出了NovaDrive，这是一种单分支视觉语言架构，处理来自前置摄像头、高清地图切片、激光雷达深度及文本航点输入，并应用两阶段跨注意力模块对航点和地图进行对齐，然后对图像和深度信息进行精细吸附。通过平滑损失机制，避免了转向和速度的突然变化，并免除循环记忆的需求。

Result: 在MD-NEX室外基准测试的NuScenes/Waymo子集上，NovaDrive提高了成功率至84%（+4%），路径效率（SPL）提高到0.66（+0.11），碰撞频率由2.6%降至1.2%（-1.4%）。

Conclusion: NovaDrive的设计理念成功提高了自动驾驶的安全性和效率，同时也降低了车辆的能源消耗。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road
geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce
NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes
front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a
single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns
waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image
and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt
steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent
memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language
backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the
MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts
path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from
2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations
confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention
fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's
shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower
fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving
stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

### [7] [Reference-Guided Diffusion Inpainting For Multimodal Counterfactual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23058)
*Alexandru Buburuzan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种合成数据生成方法，MObI和AnydoorMed，分别应用于自动驾驶和医学影像，利用扩散模型实现了高现实性和可控的对象修补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全关键应用需要广泛的多模态数据进行严格测试，而收集真实数据的成本和复杂性促使合成数据方法变得突出。这项工作旨在提供高现实性和可控性的合成数据生成方法，以便在自动驾驶和医学影像分析中有效应用。

Method: 本文引入两种新的合成数据生成方法：MObI用于自动驾驶领域的多模态对象修补框架，和AnydoorMed用于医学成像领域的参考导向修补方法。两者均利用扩散模型实现现实且可控的数据生成。

Result: MObI在给定单张参考RGB图像的情况下，实现了在现有多模态场景中无缝插入对象，而AnydoorMed可以在乳房X光扫描中实现异常点的细节修补，同时保持结构完整性并与周边组织语义融合。

Conclusion: 这些方法证明了自然图像的参考导向修补基础模型可以适用于多样的感知模态，为构建高度真实、可控的多模态反事实场景的新一代系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

### [8] [Vision-Language Fusion for Real-Time Autonomous Driving: Goal-Centered Cross-Attention of Camera, HD-Map, & Waypoints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23064)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan,Murari Ambati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZ-Drive模型通过早期融合意图和地图布局，实现高效且准确的自动驾驶，超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶汽车需要几何准确性和语义理解来在复杂环境中导航，而大多数系统分别处理它们。该研究旨在通过单一视觉语言模型来统一处理这两者。

Method: XYZ-Drive模型读取前置摄像头帧、25m x 25m的俯视图地图和下一个航点，然后输出转向和速度。使用轻量级目标中心交叉注意力层让航点标记高亮相关图像和地图部分，然后将融合的标记输入部分微调的LLaMA-3.2 11B模型。

Result: 在MD-NEX户外驾驶基准上，XYZ-Drive达到了95%的成功率和0.80的路径长度加权成功率（SPL），比PhysNav-DG高出15%，碰撞率减半，并且显著提高了效率。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过在意图与地图布局的早期、标记级别进行融合，可以实现准确、透明和实时的自动驾驶。

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

### [9] [Vocabulary-free Fine-grained Visual Recognition via Enriched Contextually Grounded Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23070)
*Dmitry Demidov,Zaigham Zaheer,Omkar Thawakar,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了无需训练的新方法E-FineR，实现细粒度视觉识别的最新技术水平，适用于无法获得注释的新领域，并支持零样本和小样本分类，代码公开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在使用大语言模型进行分类时的能力有限，且依赖于大语言模型提供的猜测类名，没有进行深入分析和改进，限制了细粒度图像分类的可扩展性和适用性。

Method: 提出了一种名为Enriched-FineR的训练无关新方法，在无需预先定义类标签的情况下结合大语言模型和视觉语言模型，实现开集识别。

Result: 在零样本和小样本分类任务中，E-FineR无需训练且无需人工干预，性能可与现有最先进技术相媲美。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种无需训练的方法Enriched-FineR，实现了在细粒度视觉识别任务上的最新技术水平，具有良好的解释性和实用性，尤其适用于无法获得专家注释的新领域。

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is
available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

### [10] [Details Matter for Indoor Open-vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23134)
*Sanghun Jung,Jingjing Zheng,Ke Zhang,Nan Qiao,Albert Y. C. Chen,Lu Xia,Chi Liu,Yuyin Sun,Xiao Zeng,Hsiang-Wei Huang,Byron Boots,Min Sun,Cheng-Hao Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出结合多概念的开放词汇表3D实例分割方法，通过两阶段方案和Alpha-CLIP模型取得了优异的性能，优于封闭词汇表方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有研究提出了多种概念用于开放词汇表3D实例分割，但这些概念不是互斥的，而是互补的。为解决关键挑战，本文旨在设计一种结合这些概念的配方，优化解决方案。

Method: 本文提出的解决方案遵循两阶段方案：生成3D提案和实例分类。我们采用基于3D跟踪的提案聚合进行3D提案生成，并通过迭代合并/移除的方式减少重叠或部分提案。在分类阶段，使用Alpha-CLIP模型代替标准CLIP模型，结合对象蒙版作为alpha通道来减少背景噪声，实现对象中心的表示。此外，引入了标准化最大相似度（SMS）得分以过滤假阳性，提高精度。

Result: 我们的框架在ScanNet200和S3DIS数据集上所有AP和AR指标上实现了最先进的性能，甚至超过了端到端封闭词汇表方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的OV-3DIS解决方案，通过结合和优化多个概念，有效提升性能，并在各种AP和AR指标中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify
them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we
observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but
complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D
tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove
overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the
classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which
incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and
obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the
standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal
similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS
across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary
method.

### [11] [X-NeMo: Expressive Neural Motion Reenactment via Disentangled Latent Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23143)
*Xiaochen Zhao,Hongyi Xu,Guoxian Song,You Xie,Chenxu Zhang,Xiu Li,Linjie Luo,Jinli Suo,Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-NeMo是一种创新的无监督扩散肖像动画系统，通过解决身份泄漏问题实现生动动画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在静态肖像动画过程中身份泄漏和捕捉微妙、极端表情的困难。

Method: 提出一种端到端训练框架，使用1D身份无关潜在动作描述符，通过交叉注意力控制图像生成中的动作，增强表达性并通过双GAN解码器监督其学习。

Result: 广泛实验表明，X-NeMo优于现有技术基线，产生高度生动的动画，同时保持卓越的身份相似度。

Conclusion: X-NeMo通过零散扩散基础设施消除身份泄漏，成功地实现了高度生动的肖像动画。

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation
pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving
video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of
the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in
capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D
identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively
controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our
implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,
learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained
motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion
latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN
decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving
motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention
rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission
of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion
backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly
expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models
are available for research.

### [12] [Neural Multi-View Self-Calibrated Photometric Stereo without Photometric Stereo Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23162)
*Xu Cao,Takafumi Taketomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该方法提出神经逆渲染方法，在多视图下实现对场景参数的精确重建并优于现有技术，无需光照校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进多视图成像下不需要光照校准或中间提示处理的形状、反射率和光照环境重建。

Method: 我们的方法联合优化所有场景参数，直接从原始图像中产生结果。我们使用神经隐函数场来表示几何和反射率，并应用阴影感知体积渲染。空间网络预测每个场景点的符号距离和反射率潜在编码，而反射率网络则基于该编码和角度编码的表面法向量、视图及光照方向估计反射率值。

Result: 利用阴影感知体积渲染和神经隐函数场，直接优化出准确的场景参数，实现不需要中间法线图的高精度几何和光照重建。

Conclusion: 该方法优于现有的法向量指导方法，在形状和光照估计的精度上表现更出色，并且能够推广到视图不对齐的多光图像，同时处理具有挑战性几何和反射率的物体。

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs
geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from
multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior
multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or
intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes
all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both
geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware
volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a
reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then
estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly
encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting
estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and
handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

Conclusion: 新方法使用Corner Loss和R-CBAM模块提升了降雨纹去除过程中的图像恢复能力，显著优于以往方法。

Abstract: The problem of single-image rain streak removal goes beyond simple noise
suppression, requiring the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details
and overall visual quality. In this study, we propose a novel image restoration
network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a
Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture
information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual
Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and
decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and
channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions
heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the
Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on
Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.

Conclusion: 提出了一种包含文本、音频、视频和动作四种模态的框架，在动作获取中实现了多通道检索，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%
improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in
R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our
results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal
counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for
advancing motion acquisition.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel dataset for segmenting flooded areas in
satellite images. After reviewing 77 existing benchmarks utilizing satellite
imagery, we identified a shortage of suitable datasets for this specific task.
To fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA
floods from Planet Explorer by Planet Labs (Image \c{opyright} 2024 Planet Labs
PBC). The dataset consists of 10 satellite images per location, each containing
both flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the
five states: Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The dataset
ensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating
semantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in
computer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted
an ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.
Overall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for
future multimodal and temporal learning strategies. The dataset will be

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型对抗攻击方法AGD，通过扩散模型有效生成对抗图像，实验结果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗性图像生成方法容易因传统防御方法失效，因此需要一种新的生成对抗图像的方式，以有效地欺骗多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）并避免对原图像产生明显失真。

Method: 提出了一种名为对抗引导扩散（AGD）的新方法，该方法通过在逆扩散过程中向噪声成分注入目标语义来进行对抗攻击，并在生成对抗图像时，将其表示为干净图像和噪声的线性组合。

Result: 实验表明，AGD在攻击性能和模型抵抗某些防御手段的能力上优于现有的方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的AGD方法在攻击性能和模型鲁棒性方面优于现有最先进的方法。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

Motivation: 晶体团聚中存在水分透过性问题和显微图像视角限制，导致人工标注困难，因此需要自动化方法提高团聚识别的精准性。

Method: 首先提出监督基线模型生成分割伪标签，然后训练实例分类模型进行像素级分割，最后在推理阶段结合两者优势，同时设计后处理模块以保留晶体特性。

Result: 该方法在不同置信度水平下成功分类潜在团聚实例，改善了分类准确率和尺寸分布预测。

Conclusion: 通过结合分类和分割模型的方法，提高了晶体团聚分类准确性和尺寸分布预测，结果优于现有方法。

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了YOLO-ROC模型，通过增强多尺度特征提取与通道压缩，提升小目标检测精度并降低计算复杂性，适合高效实时应用。


<details>

Motivation: 目前基于深度学习的道路损坏检测方法由于多尺度特征提取能力不足和模型计算复杂度高，导致小规模损坏漏检率高，以及实时检测效率低。

Method: 提出一种高精度轻量化模型YOLO-ROC，设计了BMS-SPPF模块增强多尺度特征提取，并采用分层通道压缩策略以降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在RDD2022_China_Drone数据集上，YOLO-ROC实现了67.6%的mAP50，比基线YOLOv8n高出2.11%；小目标D40类别的mAP50提升了16.8%，最终模型大小仅为2.0 MB。此外，在RDD2022_China_Motorbike数据集上也表现出良好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: YOLO-ROC有效提升了小目标检测能力，同时减小了模型参数量和计算复杂性，适用于实际中的高效实时检测。

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

Abstract: As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life,
ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of its virtual content is critical. Our
research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that
which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We
developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using
vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on
this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually
aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks;
and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR
devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned
framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual
modeling, multimodal AR content implementation, and lightweight model
adaptation.

TL;DR: 本文重定义了Semi-FSCIL，并提出ALDC策略来改善未标记数据的使用，有效提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的半监督少样本增量学习方法在使用未标记数据时，仅限制于当前会话的新类，缺乏实用性，因此重新定义为GSemi-FSCIL，包含基础和所有曾见新类的未标记样本。

Method: 提出了一种模糊引导可学习分布校准(ALDC)策略，该策略动态地使用丰富的基础样本来校正少样本新类的偏置特征分布。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验证明，该方法优于现有工作，并设立了新的SOTA（最先进技术）成绩。

Conclusion: 提出的ALDC方法在三个基准数据集上优于现有的工作，设立了新的SOTA水平。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an
Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC
dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions
for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that
our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: RL-QR通过强化学习优化RAG系统的查询，使其在多模态和词汇检索器中表现显著提升，无需人工标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统高度依赖于有效的查询制定来获取外部知识，而优化查询以适应多样化的非结构化现实世界文档依然是一个难题。

Method: 提出一种叫做RL-QR的强化学习框架，通过合成场景问题对和利用广义奖励政策优化（GRPO）来训练查询重写器。

Result: 在工业内部数据实验中，RL-QR在多模态RAG中实现了11%的相对增益的NDCG@3，而在词汇检索器中实现了9%的增益。

Conclusion: RL-QR具有潜力，可优化RAG系统中查询的优化。尽管在语义和混合检索器中存在挑战，但研究为进一步优化语义检索提供了方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed
CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN
pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present
what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion
tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The
CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by
multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable
clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for
multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50
subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual
experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence
with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP
dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of
pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8
fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,
oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear
nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work
contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient
and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing
the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through
visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based
approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few
existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single

presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of
representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from
multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,
highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven

TL;DR: 提出了时间序列几何结构指数（TGSI），并通过引入形态感知时间损失（SATL）改善训练效果，使模型在TGSI和MSE指标上均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数值指标如MSE虽然能够量化点对点的准确性，但无法评估时间序列数据的几何结构。需要一种可以处理时间序列内在二维几何结构的新评价指标。

Method: 提出了TGSI指标，通过将时间序列转化为图像进行几何结构评价。由于此过程不可微分，TGSI无法直接作为训练损失。为此，提出了SATL，即在时间序列模态下操作的多组件损失函数来解决此问题并增强结构建模。SATL结合了三个组件：一阶差分损失、频域损失和感知特征损失。

Result: 实验表明，使用SATL训练的模型在多个数据集上都表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: 使用SATL训练的模型在MSE和TGSI指标上都超过了基线方法，而且在推理过程中没有额外的计算成本。

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的SATL算法，动态调整类别特定的阈值，通过实验验证在有限标签条件下能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在生成伪标签时忽视了类别间得分分布的变化，导致伪标签不准确不完整，从而影响性能。因此需要一种通过语义感知自适应调整阈值的方法。

Method: 引入了Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL)算法，动态计算每个类别的正负样本得分分布，并设定类别特定的阈值，这些分布和阈值在学习过程中不断更新。同时，应用差异排名损失来增强正负样本得分分布的区分度。

Result: 在大规模多标签数据集（如Microsoft COCO和VG-200）的实验和分析中，我们的方法显著改善了有限标签情况下的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL)算法有效地提升了有限标签情况下的多标签图像识别性能。

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to
train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely
on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified
labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

Motivation: 现有扩散变压器方法依赖VAE，易引入累积误差和解码伪影。

Method: 通过神经场对图像进行块状解码，提出像素神经场扩散单阶段高效方案。

Result: 在ImageNet上，PixNerd实现了无复杂管道的高效结果：256x256的FID为2.15，512x512的FID为2.84；在文本到图像任务中，PixNerd-XXL/16在GenEval基准测试中获得0.73总分，在DPG基准测试中获得80.9总分。

Conclusion: 单阶段像素神经场扩散（PixelNerd）方法在图像生成中表现优异，无需复杂级联管道或VAE。

Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the
compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE).
However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated
errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems,
researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines
and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to
model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,
single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field
diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in
PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID
on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also
extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16
achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9
overall score on the DPG benchmark.

TL;DR: 研究表明，SAM2模型在乳腺MRI中的3D肿瘤分割效果良好，提供了一种低成本和低要求的解决方案，适合资源有限地区应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI工具有望加速医疗图像分析，但在低收入和中等收入国家，由于高昂的许可证费用、专有软件和基础设施要求，商业医学AI产品的应用仍然有限。

Method: 在乳腺MRI中使用SAM2，通过单个切片上的边界框注释，结合三种不同的切片追踪策略（自上而下、自下而上和从中心向外），将分割预测传递到3D体积。

Result: 尽管SAM2未经过体积医学数据训练，但在最小监督下取得了强大的分割性能。中心向外传播在分割一致性和准确性方面表现最好。

Conclusion: SAM2可以在乳腺MRI中进行低成本、最小输入的3D肿瘤分割，为资源有限的环境提供了可访问且经济实惠的替代方案。

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

*Gyeongjin Kang,Seungtae Nam,Xiangyu Sun,Sameh Khamis,Abdelrahman Mohamed,Eunbyung Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效可扩展的3D重建模型iLRM，通过三种核心机制解决计算成本高的问题，在多个数据集上显示出了超越现有方法的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于变压器架构的方法由于依赖多个视图图像Token的全注意机制，导致的计算成本随视图数量和图像分辨率增加而急剧增加的可扩展性问题。

Method: 引入了一种迭代大规模3D重建模型（iLRM），通过迭代优化生成3D高斯体表示，以分解全注意力多视图交互为两阶段注意方案并在每层注入高分辨率信息来实现高保真重建。

Result: 实验结果表明，iLRM在RE10K和DL3DV等常用数据集上，在重建质量和速度方面均优于现有方法，并具有更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: iLRM在重建质量和速度上优于现有方法，并在相当的计算成本下通过有效利用更多输入视图显著提高了重建质量。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and
high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D
representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant
attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous
applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger
number of input views.

*Hao Tang,Chenwei Xie,Xiaoyi Bao,Tingyu Weng,Pandeng Li,Yun Zheng,Liwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniLIP 强化了 CLIP，对理解、生成和编辑任务均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP 的统一方法通常需要额外的扩散解码器或量化来支持重构和生成任务，导致重构不一致或理解性能下降。

Method: 论文提出了一个两阶段训练方案和自我蒸馏策略，以逐步将重构能力整合到 CLIP 中，并提出了一种双重条件架构，将 MLLM 和扩散变压器连接起来。

Result: 在文本到图像生成任务中，UniLIP 在 GenEval 和 WISE 基准上分别获得了 0.87 和 0.53 的分数，均超过了以往的同规模统一模型。在图像编辑中，它在 ImgEdit 基准上获得了 3.62 分，也超过了最新的先进模型。

Conclusion: UniLIP 扩展了 CLIP 的应用范围，使其不仅在理解任务中表现出色，还在生成和编辑任务中表现出高度的竞争力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

### [31] [Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with Multi-Modal Large Language Models for Text-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23284)
*Dohwan Ko,Ji Soo Lee,Minhyuk Choi,Zihang Meng,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLiM framework with CPN improves text-video retrieval by addressing candidate bias and outperforms existing models significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Naive application of MLLMs in text-video retrieval introduces candidate prior bias, leading to less relevant matches despite high likelihood.

Method: BLiM (Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM) combines query and candidate likelihood by training models to generate text from videos and video features from text. CPN (Candidate Prior Normalization) is introduced to adjust scores and reduce candidate prior bias without additional training.

Result: BLiM with CPN outperforms state-of-the-art models by 6.4 R@1 on average across four benchmarks, and CPN proves broadly applicable in reducing textual prior reliance and enhancing visual understanding in multi-modal tasks.

Conclusion: BLiM equipped with CPN effectively mitigates candidate prior bias and enhances query-candidate relevance, achieving state-of-the-art performance in text-video retrieval.

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

### [32] [LED Benchmark: Diagnosing Structural Layout Errors for Document Layout Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23295)
*Inbum Heo,Taewook Hwang,Jeesu Jung,Sangkeun Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduced LED, a new benchmark for evaluating document layout robustness which exposes errors not detected by current metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional evaluation metrics for Document Layout Analysis primarily focus on spatial overlap and are inadequate for identifying critical structural errors.

Method: Proposed the Layout Error Detection (LED) benchmark, which includes eight error types and three tasks: error existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error classification. Created a synthetic LED-Dataset with structural errors for testing.

Result: LED shows promising results in differentiating the structural understanding of layout models and exposes modality biases and trade-offs that traditional metrics do not.

Conclusion: LED benchmark effectively reveals structural robustness in document layout predictions and highlights previously unseen biases and trade-offs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models
and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However,
despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural
errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional
evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap,
are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we
propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight
standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error
existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type
classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset
generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical
distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs
reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding
capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible
through traditional metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的几何图像编辑方法，通过解耦处理流程提高编辑效果，新的FreeFine方法表现优异。代码和基准测试已开放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往基于扩散的方法在几何图像编辑中面临挑战，尤其是在变换对象较大或结构复杂时。

Method: 提出了一种解耦的流程，将对象的变换、源区域修复和目标区域优化分离处理，并使用免训练扩散方法FreeFine进行修复和优化。

Result: 在新的GeoBench基准测试中，FreeFine在图像保真度和编辑精度上超越了现有的先进方法，尤其是在要求较高的变形操作下。

Conclusion: 通过将几何图像编辑任务分成独立的步骤，可以更有效地处理复杂的变换。FreeFine在多个基准测试中显示了其优越性。

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an
image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene
coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all
relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations
become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled
pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and
target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using
a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new
GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit
precision, especially under demanding transformations. Code and benchmark are
available at: https://github.com/CIawevy/FreeFine

TL;DR: ST-SAM框架在仅用1%标注数据下，通过自训练及领域知识伪标签的混合提示，实现了超越现有方法的伪装物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SSCOD方法中，教师-学生框架在稀少监督下易产生预测偏差和误差传播，且其多网络架构计算开销高，扩展性有限。

Method: 本文提出的ST-SAM框架采用自训练策略，动态过滤和扩展高置信度伪标签，以增强单模型架构，并通过将伪标签转换为含有领域知识的混合提示，有效利用Segment Anything Model进行自训练。

Result: ST-SAM在COD基准数据集上的实验表明，其在仅有1%的标注数据时已达到最先进的性能，超越了现有SSCOD方法，甚至匹敌全监督方法。

Conclusion: ST-SAM提出了一种新的高效半监督伪装物体检测框架，打破了传统SSCOD方法的限制，能够在仅有1%标注数据的情况下达到最先进的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance
on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and
abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific
knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential
for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.
Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or
loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient
SSCOD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/hu-xh/ST-SAM.

TL;DR: PriorFusion框架通过整合语义、几何和生成先验，利用实例感知注意机制和扩散框架显著提高自动驾驶场景中的道路元素感知精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶领域对精准且可靠的道路感知技术需求日益增长。在没有高清地图支持的复杂环境中，自动驾驶车辆必须独立解释周围环境以确保安全和稳健的决策。然而，由于道路元素众多、几何结构复杂且经常遮挡，这些场景具有重大挑战。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为PriorFusion的统一框架，有效整合了语义、几何和生成先验以增强道路元素感知。首先引入了一个由形状先验特征引导的实例感知注意机制，然后构建了一个数据驱动的形状模板空间，编码道路元素的低维表示，启用聚类以生成作为参考先验的锚点。最后设计了一个基于扩散的框架，利用这些先验锚点生成准确且完整的预测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在大规模自动驾驶数据集上显著提高了感知精度，尤其是在具有挑战性条件下的表现。可视化结果进一步验证了该方法可产生更准确、规则和连贯的道路元素预测。

Conclusion: PriorFusion框架通过有效整合多种先验，不仅提高了道路感知的准确性，还在复杂场景中表现出色，验证了其在自动驾驶应用中的潜力和优势。

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

Motivation: 在持续学习（CL）背景下处理模型合并的问题，旨在研究如何在模型合并过程中保存和增强共享知识。

Method: 利用计算机视觉实验中的可控视觉线索来研究模型合并的效果。

Result: 合并模型时，共享知识基本上被保留或增强，而未共享的任务特定知识会快速退化。渐进训练过程中合并的模型性能优于并行训练后的模型。

Conclusion: 线性合并模型对于共享知识有积极的影响，但对任务特定知识不利，渐增训练合并策略效果更佳。

Abstract: This paper investigates the linear merging of models in the context of
continual learning (CL). Using controlled visual cues in computer vision
experiments, we demonstrate that merging largely preserves or enhances shared
knowledge, while unshared task-specific knowledge rapidly degrades. We further
find that merging models from an incremental training process consistently
outperforms merging models trained in parallel.

Motivation: 扩散模型在艺术创作中表现出色，但其内部如何表示内容和风格仍未得到深入研究。

Method: 通过使用跨注意力热图，将生成图像的像素与特定提示词进行关联，以隔离受内容描述和风格描述影响的图像区域。

Result: 发现扩散模型根据艺术提示和风格请求，表现出不同程度的内容-风格分离。

Conclusion: 揭示了扩散模型具有对内容和风格的区分能力，并加深了我们对生成模型如何表示复杂艺术概念的理解。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention
maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

<details>

Motivation: 轻量级卷积和基于变压器的模型对于在资源有限的环境中进行实时图像分类非常重要，因此有必要研究超参数调整对模型性能的影响，以及如何在不增加延迟和内存开销的情况下提高准确性和收敛速度。

Method: 该研究通过在ImageNet-1K数据集上进行一致的训练设置，重点关注实时应用的实际性，进行全面的消融研究，以分离关键超参数（如学习率计划、批量大小、输入分辨率、数据增强、正则化方法和优化器选择）的影响。并评估每个模型在GPU加速的边缘设备模拟中不仅在Top-1和Top-5分类准确率方面，还在推理时间、参数数量、模型大小和每秒帧数（FPS）等方面的表现。

Result: 研究结果显示，余弦学习率衰减和可调批量大小可以显著提高准确率和收敛速度，同时保持低延迟和内存成本。特别是，RepVGG-A2在实现超过80% Top-1准确率的同时还表现出了高效的推理性能，为VGG样式模型提供了一种令人信服的准确性和部署成本平衡的方案。该研究为构建适合实时图像处理流水线的资源高效型深度学习模型提供了实际指导。

Conclusion: 在资源有限的应用中，如嵌入式系统和边缘设备，轻量级卷积和基于变压器的模型对于实时图像分类至关重要。通过对EfficientNetV2-S、ConvNeXt-T、MobileViT v2、MobileNetV3-L、TinyViT-21M和RepVGG-A2这七种高效深度学习架构的训练，研究了超参数调整对准确率和收敛行为的影响。结果表明，某些超参数调整可以显著提高准确率和收敛速度，同时保持低延迟和内存开销。

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for
real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as
embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of
hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT
v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,
regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for
real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter
count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge
deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and
adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,
while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%
Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling
balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results

Conclusion: FastDriveVLA通过ReconPruner在nuScenes闭环规划基准上取得了最先进的结果，展示了其在自动驾驶场景中视觉令牌剪枝的优越性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

Motivation: 医疗图像的分割在临床工作流程中至关重要，但因领域转移而导致性能下降是一个挑战。这种变化主要是由于成像条件、扫描仪类型和采集协议的不同限制了分割模型的实际应用。

Method: 提出了一种专门针对医疗图像分割的领域泛化框架。方法通过引入隐式特征扰动来增强对领域特异性变化的鲁棒性，使用可学习的语义方向选择器和基于协方差的语义强度采样器来调节领域变异特征，同时保留任务相关的解剖一致性。还设计了一种自适应一致性约束，用于在特征调整导致分割性能下降时才选择性应用，以稳定特征选择并提高分割可靠性。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在两个公共多中心基准上表现优于现有的领域泛化方法，实现了在不同临床领域中的稳健和广泛适用的分割性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的领域泛化框架能够解决医疗图像分割中的领域转移问题，提高不同临床领域的分割鲁棒性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

Conclusion: 本文提出的两阶段框架通过结合开放词汇检测和跨模态学习，有效提高了交通标志的识别性能。

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving
perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and
driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

TL;DR: We developed a robust road surface reconstruction framework addressing occlusions and visual clutter, outperforming previous methods in urban settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with occlusions, visual clutter, and appearance degradation in urban environments, affecting autonomous driving performance.

Method: We employ an occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels and semantic-guided color enhancement approach, utilizing planar-adapted Gaussian representation, segmentation-guided video inpainting, and semantic-aware color correction in the HSV color space.

Result: The proposed framework achieves superior road surface reconstructions in urban datasets, effectively handling occlusions and visual clutter.

Conclusion: Our framework yields visually coherent and geometrically faithful road reconstructions, surpassing existing methods in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting
centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex
urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions,
they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from
static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather
changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates
occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to
recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted
Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs
segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static
foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction
in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that
our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful
reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world
conditions.

Method: 使用WIDER FACE 数据集，对三个深度学习型人脸检测器进行系统评估，测试不同图像分辨率下的检测性能，并使用多种指标进行评估，如精度、召回率、mAP50、mAP50-95 和推理时间。

Result: 结果表明，在检测准确性方面，YOLOv11在高分辨率下表现最佳，YOLOv12在召回率方面表现稍好，而MTCNN在实时推理速度方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: YOLOv11在高分辨率条件下，在检测准确性方面优于YOLOv12和MTCNN，YOLOv12在召回率方面稍微表现得更好，而MTCNN在实时推理速度方面表现不佳。

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Motivation: 尽管AGTH已经成为一种新的数字人类媒体，但在这些讲述者和他们生成的AGTH质量方面仍然存在挑战，而且针对这些问题的全面研究相对较少。

Method: 提供了一个新的AGTH质量评估数据集THQA-10K，通过选取12个T2I模型和14个高级讲述者生成AGTHs，志愿者对AGTH进行主观评分并给出相应的失真类别。此外，还提出了基于第一帧、Y-T切片和音调唇形一致性的客观质量评估方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的客观质量评估方法在AGTH质量评估中达到了最新水平。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于第一帧、Y-T切片和音调唇形一致性的客观质量评估方法，达到了AGTH质量评估的最新水平。

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers"
because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial
movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)
models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging
digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

Conclusion: 本文通过分析六篇具有影响力的论文，总结了计算机视觉领域关键设计模式的演变。这些模式包括残差网络、视觉Transformer、生成对抗网络、潜在扩散模型及自监督学习技术。

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型的实际应用受到模型参数巨大和计算成本高的限制。

Method: 通过实验发现非关键的视觉语言tokens和层间特征差异是修剪层的关键挑战，提出了一种新的框架Short-LVLM (SVL)，利用重要的视觉语言tokens并减少层间特征差异。

Result: Short-LVLM在性能和效率之间达到了优越的平衡，还具有多项潜在优势，如无需训练、模型无关和高度兼容。

Conclusion: 直接将NLP的层剪枝方法应用于LVLMs是无效的，通过提出的Short-LVLM框架能够更加有效地应用于视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the high computational costs associated with the Transformer's attention mechanism in learning-based feature matching methods, by introducing an efficient alternative with comparable performance.

Method: The paper proposes a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network that integrates Mamba's Selective State-Space Model with the Transformer's attention mechanism for semi-dense feature matching.

Result: VMatcher achieves comparable or superior performance to existing methods with significant efficiency gains, demonstrating robust and practical real-time application capabilities.

Conclusion: VMatcher sets new benchmarks efficiently in image pair feature matching by combining the computational efficiency of Mamba with the effective attention mechanism of Transformers.

Abstract: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for
semi-dense feature matching between image pairs. Learning-based feature
matching methods, whether detector-based or detector-free, achieve
state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention
mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its
quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space
Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear
complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid
approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with
the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are
proposed, including hierarchical architectures, demonstrating their
effectiveness in setting new benchmarks efficiently while ensuring robustness
and practicality for real-time applications where rapid inference is crucial.

Conclusion: 通过联合训练和生成驱动的双反馈过程，UniEmo在情感理解和生成任务上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained
model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these
generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding
capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为MP^2A的渐进式对齐策略，能够有效解决多源领域自适应中的噪声问题，促进更鲁棒的收敛与真正的领域不变特征学习。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural

leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene

<details>

Motivation: 当前医学领域的视觉-语言预训练方法往往简化了临床报告，忽略了它们的内在结构，并且对比学习框架依赖大量的硬负样本，针对医药小规模数据集而言并不实际。

Method: 提出自适应分组对齐（AGA）框架，通过稀疏相似度矩阵进行双向分组机制，实现图像文本细粒度相似度计算，并设计语言和视觉分组门模块，动态学习分组阈值，同时引入实例感知分组对齐损失以消除外部负样本的需求。

Result: 在公开和私有数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在图像文本检索和分类任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: AGA这种框架有效地提升了医学视觉表示学习的性能，尤其是在图像文本检索和分类任务中，无论是微调还是零样本设置下。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 当前生成方法依赖于似然估计或重建误差，但这些方法计算量大，不可靠，并且当内在数据发生变化时需重新训练。这些局限性妨碍了其有效、稳定和可靠地区分普通和异常输入的能力。

Method: 提出了一种基于Stein得分的去噪扩散模型(SBDDM)的重建自由OOD检测方法，通过前向扩散轨迹捕捉轨迹曲率，实现精确异常评分，只需五个扩散步骤。

Result: SBDDM方法在多个近域OOD和远域OOD基准上有效泛化，达到了最新性能，并极大地降低了推理过程中的计算成本。

Conclusion: SBDDM方法在近域OOD和远域OOD检测方面相比现有方法可提供10.43%和18.10%的相对改善，能够显著降低推理过程中的计算成本，并适用于实时可靠的计算机辅助诊断。

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

*Abdellah Zakaria Sellam,Salah Eddine Bekhouche,Cosimo Distante,Abdelmalik Taleb-Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过用Kolmogorov-Arnold网络代替传统方法，该研究在WikiArt和Pandora18k数据集上实现了更高的艺术风格分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前艺术风格分类困难主要由于缺乏专业标记数据集及风格元素的复杂非线性相互作用。虽然双教师自监督框架减少了对标记数据的依赖，但其线性投影层和局部化聚焦难以有效描述全局组成情境及复杂风格交互。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（KANs）替代传统MLP投影和预测头，双教师网络分别关注局部纹理与笔触模式及广泛的风格层级，并利用KANs的样条激活函数精确建模特征之间的非线性相关。

Result: 在WikiArt和Pandora18k数据集上的实验表明，该方法在Top-1准确率上优于基础的双教师架构，显示出KANs在解开复杂风格流形中的重要性，并以优于MLP投影的线性探测准确性。

Conclusion: 在艺术风格分类任务中，采用Kolmogorov-Arnold网络替代传统的多层感知机，使得模型能够更好地描述非线性特征相关性，从而提高分类准确性。

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational
aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate,
often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher
self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear
projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional
context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher
knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing
conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher
networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other
capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based
activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical
precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings
highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds,
leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为HyCASS的模型，用于可调节的高光谱图像压缩，证明其在不同的压缩比例下具有优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高光谱数据档案在遥感领域快速增长，高效存储需求变得重要，因此需要对学习型高光谱图像压缩进行深入研究，特别是光谱和空间压缩的单独及联合效应尚未被全面考察。

Method: 提出了一种名为HyCASS的可调节空间-光谱高光谱图像压缩网络模型，模型由六个主要模块组成，这些模块利用卷积层和Transformer块来捕获短程和长程冗余。

Result: 实验结果表明，与现有的基于学习的压缩模型相比，HyCASS模型的可调节特性在不同压缩比例下效果更佳，并提供了在不同压缩比例下有效平衡光谱和空间压缩的指导原则。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的HyCASS模型在HSI压缩方面表现优越，尤其在不同压缩比例下能够有效平衡光谱和空间压缩，在两套基准数据集上的实验结果证实了这一点。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS),
the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant
attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However,
a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral
and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been
thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for
understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint
spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we
propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network
(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in
both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)
spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter
encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder
module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to
capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on
two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based
on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and
spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial
resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of
research in which data is used to train algorithms, learn patterns, and make
predictions. This approach helps to solve seemingly intricate problems with
significant accuracy without explicit programming by recognizing complex

implement two machine learning algorithms, namely, a baseline convolutional

machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline
CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem
presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that
DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray
images in its decision-making more than the baseline CNN.

Motivation: 虽然联邦学习在分类任务上取得成功，但在非分类任务（如人体姿态估计）中的应用尚未被广泛探索。发现并研究了一个关键问题“分辨率漂移”，导致由于不同客户端的分辨率变化而性能显著下降。

Method: 提出了一种名为RAF的分辨率自适应联邦学习方法，通过在高分辨率输出（教师）与低分辨率输出（学生）之间的多分辨率知识蒸馏，增强了分辨率的鲁棒性。

Result: RAF可以有效缓解分辨率漂移并显著提升性能，且能够无缝集成到现有联邦学习框架中。此外，t-SNE分析支持RAF方法对依赖空间细节的其它任务的推广性。

Conclusion: 文章提出了一种解决分辨率漂移问题的新方法RAF，该方法通过热图知识蒸馏提升分辨率鲁棒性，显著改善非分类任务如人体姿态估计的性能，且能够无缝融入现有的联邦学习框架。

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across
distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has
primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication
efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.
However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose
estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a
critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades
significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level
heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as
another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To
address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a
method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through
multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs
(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances
resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and
theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates
resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also
can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although
this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals
distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution
representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks
that rely on preserving spatial detail.

TL;DR: CST Anti-UAV是一个新的热红外数据集，用于复杂场景中微型无人机的跟踪，展示了现有方法在此方面的局限性，并推动研究进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无人机跟踪数据集主要是显眼的目标，缺乏场景复杂性和属性多样性，限制了其在现实场景中的应用。

Method: 提出一个名为CST Anti-UAV的热红外数据集，专门用于复杂场景中微型无人机的单目标跟踪，并通过评估20种现有SOT方法对其进行深入性能分析。

Result: 实验结果表明，在复杂环境中跟踪微型无人机仍具挑战性，最先进的方法仅能达到35.92%的状态准确率，远低于在Anti-UAV410数据集上观察到的67.69%。

Conclusion: CST Anti-UAV是一个专为单目标跟踪设计的新数据集，可以促进更强大SOT方法的发展并驱动反无人机系统的创新。

Abstract: The widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised
serious public safety and privacy concerns, making UAV perception crucial for
anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature
conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute
representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared
dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex
Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k
high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a
significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex
scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to
incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise
evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance
analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex
environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only
35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410
dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and
the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV
benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the
development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV
systems.

Motivation: 现有的3D视觉语言模型（VLMs）在健壮性和泛化能力方面存在不足，尤其是由于高质量空间数据的缺乏及视点静态假设的影响。

Method: 提出3D-R1基础模型，通过构建高质量合成数据集Scene-30K和借助RLHF策略如GRPO进行强化学习训练来增强推理能力，并引入三个奖励函数：感知奖励、语义相似性奖励和格式奖励。此外，采用动态视角选择策略以适应性选择信息最丰富的视角进行3D场景理解。

Conclusion: 3D-R1通过增强3D视觉语言模型的推理能力和动态视角选择策略，在3D场景理解任务中取得显著效果。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D
visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities
to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust
reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data
and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we
propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of
3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with
CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine
based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1.
Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning
training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward
functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format
reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.
Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively
chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%
across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing
reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding. Code:

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating
the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent
challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge
devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation
by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy
consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging
due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the
overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that
combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the
gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small
intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we
consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the
feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first
multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating
established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series
analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a
significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves
an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on
the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized 3D point cloud processing, yet
efficiently handling large and irregular point clouds remains challenging. To
tackle this problem, we introduce FastPoint, a novel software-based

curve, we can efficiently identify subsequent sample points without
exhaustively computing all pairwise distances. Our proposal substantially
accelerates farthest point sampling and neighbor search operations while

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种名为Stable-Sim2Real的数据驱动3D模拟新解决方案，通过一个创新的两阶段深度扩散模型，显著提高了真实世界3D视觉任务的性能，并证明了生成的3D模拟数据与真实捕获数据的高相似性。

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured
3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D
data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to
capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning
an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,
but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work
explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called
Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial
stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and
synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local
regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the
synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where
diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a
3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data
simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with
the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances
performance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation
demonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and
real-captured patterns. Project page:

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基于视觉的管道，通过集成RGB-D传感和深度学习，实现无损、实时和在线的草莓质量估计。

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field
conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations.
This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep
learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The
method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and
tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A
polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass.
Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated
strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask
inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area
ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU)
scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical
limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated

Abstract: Image fusion synthesizes complementary information from multiple sources,
mitigating the inherent limitations of unimodal imaging systems. Accurate image
registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However,
existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean
space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in
suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we
explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle
Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign
is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces
a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward
registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration
network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration
structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic
Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into
hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing
interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image
registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that
hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image
registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing
field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different
architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more
important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our
understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order
to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we
propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's
`concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the
lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,
we identify that different architectures have statistically different
concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA
models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are
misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct
classifications.

Motivation: 传统的视觉关系检测模型泛化能力不足，而现有的提示调优方法难以应对新颖或复杂的关系；因此，提出一种通过指令调优的途径来提高泛化能力。

Method: 引入ART（Adaptive Relation Tuning）框架，通过指令微调和策略性实例选择来调整视觉-语言模型，使其适用于视觉关系检测。

Result: ART方法不仅提升了基线模型性能，还能推断传统VRD方法无法识别的新颖关系概念。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的ART框架通过指令微调有效适应视觉关系检测任务，表现出对未见关系的良好推断能力。

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships
between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection
data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.
While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for
VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.
We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by
fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an
Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction
tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an
instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART
directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining
generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where
subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between
them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets
of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and
can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD
methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations
for segmenting complex scenes.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as
robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where
the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object
categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments
and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this
paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and
introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).
We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed
3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D
tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with
geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse
scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for
more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set
settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and
achieve new state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新的视觉定位方法，利用3D高斯铺设模型结合特征场，实现精确且隐私保护的定位。通过与多个真实世界数据集的测试，方法展现了领先的性能。

Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a camera pose in a known
environment. In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based
representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We
propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for
visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an
implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and
differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature
representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware
feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a
contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we
further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the
features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual
localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or
segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene
representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and
non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world
datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BeyondGloss, a gloss-free SLT framework, uses VideoLLMs and novel alignment techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges in Sign Language Translation, such as bridging the modality gap between visual and linguistic information and capturing subtle hand shapes and movements.

Method: The method involves generating fine-grained, temporally-aware textual descriptions of hand motion and using a contrastive alignment module to align these descriptions with video features during pre-training. It also uses a contrastive loss between sign video representations and target language embeddings.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks.

Conclusion: BeyondGloss achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging
the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing
subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages
the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models
(VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail,
we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual
descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these
descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to
focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively.
To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained
features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign
video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap
in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于V2X的基础设施摄像机校准方法MamV2XCalib，使用车载LiDAR辅助校准，减少了校准所需的参数，提高了性能和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着路边摄像机辅助自动驾驶车辆感知的合作系统越来越普及，大规模精确校准基础设施摄像机成为关键问题。传统手动校准方法耗时费力，且可能需要封闭道路。

Conclusion: MamV2XCalib提供了一种无需特定参考物体或手动干预的V2X自动校准方法，可有效解决车载数据缺陷和视点差异导致的校准失败问题。

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous
vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise
calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional
manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may
require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based
infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side
LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to
drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need
for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new
targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features
and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side
point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and
estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration
failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as
occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the
V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to
previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach
achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with
fewer parameters. The code is available at

Motivation: 大多数现有方法依赖于2D扩散模型合成未见视图，但生成的视图稀疏且不一致，导致不真实的3D伪影和模糊的外观，因此需要新的方法解决这些限制。

Method: 提出了一种新的生成化身模型，能够通过从学习的先验分布中采样变形高斯生成多样化的3D化身，同时将输入图像投射到其潜在空间中，并施加额外的3D外观和几何约束，确保3D一致性。

Conclusion: 我们的高斯化身在合成视图和真实世界应用中表现出色，并且具有内在的动画能力，超越了现有的技术水平。

Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian
avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen
appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.
Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;
however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in
unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,
we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by
sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the
limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all
image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,
ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and
enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel
approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by
fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The
generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting,
enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments
show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well
to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring
the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current
methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To
address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a
directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to
preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for
the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby
maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a
directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from
different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our
approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method
achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively
balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the
inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's
applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合空间和频率特征的移动感知方法Vcamba，用于改进视频伪装目标检测效果，实验表明其优于现有方法。

Motivation: 鉴于现有方法中过多依赖空间外观特征带来的检测准确性限制，研究表明频率特征能够增强特征表达并感知运动；同时，Mamba状态空间模型能够高效感知运动线索。因此，提出结合频率与空间特征的新方法。

Method: 提出了一种新的视觉伪装Mamba (Vcamba)，结合了频率和空间特征以实现高效和准确的视频伪装目标检测（VCOD）。设计了一系列模块，包括感受野视觉状态空间（RFVSS）模块、自适应频率成分增强（AFE）模块、基于空间的长距离运动感知（SLMP）模块和基于频率的长距离运动感知（FLMP）模块，以及空间频率运动融合模块（SFMF）。

Result: 实验结果表明，Vcamba在计算成本较低的情况下，在两个数据集上的六项评估指标上都超越了现有最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，我们的Vcamba在两个数据集的六个评估指标上都优于最先进的方法，并且计算成本较低。

Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on
spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage.
However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results
in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and
texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies
demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation
to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through
dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space
model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame
sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on
spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial
features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive
field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features
after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive
frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain
sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose
a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based
long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and
frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally,
the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain
features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our
Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2
datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

Motivation: 去识别保护健康信息（PHI）和个人身份信息（PII）是共享医学图像以确保符合患者隐私法的基本要求。此外，在生物医学研究中保留非PHI元数据以支持和使成像人工智能的下游开发也是重要的考虑。

Method: 挑战分为训练、验证和测试三个阶段，参与者可在训练阶段使用内部或公共数据调整其算法，验证和测试阶段使用含有合成标识符的DICOM图像进行评估。参与者使用开源和专有工具的定制配置、大型语言模型和光学字符识别（OCR）方法。

Result: 挑战的成功参与者在图像去识别任务中取得了97.91%至99.93%的高分，展示了不同工具和配置的有效性。

Conclusion: MIDI-B挑战成功地提供了一个标准化的平台，用于基于符合HIPAA Safe Harbor规定、DICOM属性保密配置文件及TCIA定义的研究关键元数据保存最佳实践的一套规则来对DICOM图像去识别工具进行基准测试。

Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and
personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for
sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure
compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI
metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial
intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The
goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM
image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor
regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in
preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and
multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic
PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and
test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase,
we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or
public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images
containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten
teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure
success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the
percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The
scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of
open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large
language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we
provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design,
implementation, results, and lessons learned.

Result: DivControl实现了最先进的可控性，训练成本降低36.4倍，同时提高了基本条件下的平均性能。实验表明，该方法在未见条件下表现出强大的零样本和少样本性能。

Conclusion: DivControl实现了最先进的可控性，训练成本降低36.4倍，同时提高了基本条件下的平均性能。它还在未见条件下表现出强大的零样本和少样本性能，展现了卓越的可扩展性、模块化和可转移性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image
(I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps,
enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train
separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with
entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation
costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable
pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient
adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic
components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into
condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge
diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented
via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the
semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and
parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve
condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation
alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art
controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously
improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong
zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior
scalability, modularity, and transferability.

Motivation: FS-CS面临的挑战是当前技术在处理小物体时的表现欠佳，因而需要改善小物体分类和分割的准确性。

Method: 提出Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT)，包含三项改进：新颖的内存高效遮罩注意力机制、可学习的降尺度策略和参数效率增强。

Result: EMAT在PASCAL-5$i$和COCO-20$i$数据集上超过所有FS-CS方法，并且使用的可训练参数至少少了四倍。

Conclusion: EMAT模型在FS-CS问题上表现优异，尤其是在处理小物体时。

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly
performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few
annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we
propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves
classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT
introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention
mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency
enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and
COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.
Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available
annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation
settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于FF的无梯度近似训练框架，提高了SNN的效率，并在多个数据集上取得了高准确率。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train
SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient
approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment
limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements
of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward
(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural
Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby
eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing
computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity
adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on
inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network
resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and
75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively,
surpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed
method exhibits significant advantages in terms of memory access and
computational power consumption.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the privacy concerns and labor-intensive nature of medical image annotation, aiming to improve the performance and generalization of segmentation models while maintaining privacy.

Method: The paper introduces a dual-model distillation approach, where a teacher model conditioned on mask-image pairs guides a mask-only student model through predicted noise alignment and adaptive regularization based on lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used.

Result: The framework shows significant improvements in mDice and mIoU scores on medical datasets, specifically TransUNet on KiTS19 and SANet on Polyps, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: Adaptively Distilled ControlNet framework outperforms state-of-the-art models in medical image segmentation by enhancing the training efficiency and enabling privacy-preserving image generation.

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and
labor-intensive labeling, significantly limiting the performance and
generalization of segmentation models. While mask-controllable diffusion models
excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We
propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework
that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation.
Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image
pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in
parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on
lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used,
enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations
on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance:
TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves
2.6%/3.5% gains on Polyps, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority. Code

*Yang Gao,Po-Chien Luan,Kaouther Messaoud,Lan Feng,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniTraj模型通过显式条件化时间元数据，实现了更好的零样本迁移性能，微调后在多个数据集上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前预训练模型在面对具有不同时间动态数据集的零样本迁移时表现有限，需要微调以适应，限制了其可扩展性和实用性。为解决这一问题，本文提出一种显式条件化时间元数据的机制。

Method: 提出了一个基于Transformer的模型OmniTraj，并在一个大型异质数据集上进行预训练。实验表明显式条件化帧率能够有效提升跨场景的预测性能。

Result: OmniTraj通过显式条件化帧率，在跨场景设置中将预测误差减少了70%以上。微调后，在NBA、JTA、WorldPose和ETH-UCY四个数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: OmniTraj模型通过显式条件化帧率，实现了卓越的零样本转移性能以及在多种数据集上的最好结果。

Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a
critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying
temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require
fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation
horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we
systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We
first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when
transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the
temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit
conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.
Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model
pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that
explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve
state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by
over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj
achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA,
WorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available:

Method: SAMSA框架结合了RGB基础模型与光谱分析，通过用户点击引导RGB分割和光谱相似性计算，实现了无视光谱带数量和分辨率的独特光谱特征融合策略。

Result: 在公有数据集上的性能评估显示，SAMSA在神经外科数据集上实现了81.0%（1点击）和93.4%（5点击）的DICE分数，和在术中的猪高光谱数据集上实现了81.1%（1点击）和89.2%（5点击）的DICE分数。实验结果证明了SAMSA在少样本和无样本学习场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical
imaging, yet encounters significant challenges due to data limitations and
hardware variations. We introduce SAMSA, a novel interactive segmentation
framework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA
efficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral
similarity computations. The method addresses key limitations in HSI
segmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates
independently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on
publicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a
neurosurgical and 81.1% 1-click and 89.2% 5-click DICE on an intraoperative
porcine hyperspectral dataset. Experimental results demonstrate SAMSA's
effectiveness in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios and using minimal

different spectral characteristics, providing a flexible framework for
hyperspectral medical image analysis.

TL;DR: I2V-GS方法通过基础设施到车辆视图的转换，大幅提升了自动驾驶数据集的合成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前驾驶数据主要由车辆收集，成本高且效率低。合成来自真实世界图像的数据是一个潜在解决方案。

Method: 该论文介绍了一种新的方法，I2V-GS，使用高斯喷洒技术将基础设施视图转换为车辆视图。采用自适应深度变换生成密集训练视图，并利用级联策略进行图像修复，以扩展视图范围。

Result: 实验结果表明，I2V-GS在车辆视角下显著提高了合成质量，并在多个指标上超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: I2V-GS框架显著提升了从基础设施视角到车辆视角的自主驾驶数据集合成质量，在NTA-Iou、NTL-Iou和FID指标上分别超越StreetGaussian 45.7%、34.2%和14.9%。

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving
systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which
is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data
from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate
photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating
driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel
method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with
Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and
rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt
the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the
range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which
also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure
the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information
to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a
multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views.
To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving
datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results
demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle
view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%,
34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.

Conclusion: 我们的研究表明，基于潜在扩散模型（LDMs）的统一图像修复框架在处理多任务和混合退化方面取得了最先进的性能，展示了扩散模型在统一图像修复中的实际潜力。

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has emerged as a promising yet
challenging research direction. To address its core challenges, we propose a
novel unified image restoration framework based on latent diffusion models
(LDMs). Our approach structurally integrates low-quality visual priors into the
diffusion process, unlocking the powerful generative capacity of diffusion
models for diverse degradations. Specifically, we design a Degradation-Aware
Feature Fusion (DAFF) module to enable adaptive handling of diverse degradation
types. Furthermore, to mitigate detail loss caused by the high compression and
iterative sampling of LDMs, we design a Detail-Aware Expert Module (DAEM) in
the decoder to enhance texture and fine-structure recovery. Extensive
experiments across multi-task and mixed degradation settings demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
practical potential of diffusion priors for unified image restoration. Our code

TL;DR: FlowGaussian-VR通过流动增强策略增强高斯视频重建，提升视觉质量与轨迹规范性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决复杂运动和显著尺度变化的视频中，现有网路失真及不足的问题。

Method: 提出了流动增强的速度场建模方案，包括速度场渲染管道和流动辅助自适应密化策略。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上，FlowGaussian-VR在视觉效果上提升显著（PSNR提高超过2.5 dB），动态纹理模糊伪影减少，且每个高斯轨迹更规范和可追踪。

Conclusion: FlowGaussian-VR improves Gaussian video reconstruction, offering better visual quality and regularized Gaussian trajectories.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time
rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has
achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great
representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with
complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often
overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual
quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for
static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic
content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity
field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed
FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering
(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a
flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and
size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on
multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple
real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not
only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry
artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian
trajectories.

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue
characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections.
For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer
explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions
translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose
the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution
method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method
iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to
create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate
a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an
enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise
distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to
estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method
not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on
the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser
Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved
explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种基于数据驱动的方法，取代了在功能图训练中常用的公理化建模，提供了更高的准确性和普适性。

Abstract: Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving
non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine
the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven
learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods
in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and
still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for
functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the
accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios
where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the
first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can
be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative
model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative
modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit
the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth
functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the
learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used
strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of
functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation
strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate
that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic
approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching. Our code is available at:

Abstract: General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance
perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions.
However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based
large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about
open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale
grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like
instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k
reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as
wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully
annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions
is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing
functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a
VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that
conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on
affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that
our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code

Motivation: 解决对象中心学习（OCL）中冗余槽位竞争和监督信号有限的问题。

Method: 提出了带有重新初始化和自蒸馏的槽注意力（DIAS）方法：通过减少聚合槽的冗余，并重新初始化额外的聚合来更新剩余槽；驱动初次聚合迭代时的劣质注意力图逼近最后迭代的优质注意力图，实现自蒸馏。

Result: DIAS在对象发现和识别等对象中心学习任务中达到了最先进的水平，并改善了高级视觉预测和推理的效果。

Conclusion: DIAS通过减少槽位冗余和引入自蒸馏，改进了对象中心学习的方法，提升了任务表现。

Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning
(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,
termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.
OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying
competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the
query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing
redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This
often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,
mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into
the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal
information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with
re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce
redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to
update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the
first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to
enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves
state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also
improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on

Conclusion: 该论文通过SeqSplatNet框架解决了复杂3D场景中顺序执行的任务，表现出了显著的性能优势。

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the
functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited
to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of
addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale
benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance
understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an
end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D
affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that
autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional
Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete
affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a
robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design
a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision
Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art
on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from
single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

Motivation: 当前的3D人体模型（例如，SMPL-X）尽管能有效地表示准确的人体形状和姿态，但由于其基于运动学特性，无法与环境进行物理交互。

Method: 提出了“半物理”机制，将3D运动学运动转化为物理模拟，在保留SMPL-X固有姿势运动学控制的同时，确保物理上合理的与场景和对象的交互。

Result: 实现了在保留原始运动学运动保真度的同时，无缝集成物理交互，并在不需要复杂训练的情况下适用于任何身体形状和运动。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种创新的方法，将SMPL-X嵌入到一个能够与环境进行动态物理交互的具体实体中，从而消除了穿透和不现实的对象动态问题。

Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently
represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically
interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result,
kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as
interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable
of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we
propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a
physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent
SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and
objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics.
Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex
training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body
shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves
the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating
physical interactions

Motivation: 随着多模态推理模型的发展，计算机使用代理（如《钢铁侠》中的Jarvis）逐渐成为现实，其中GUI定位是其执行实际操作的核心组成部分。

Method: 进行了对定位模型训练的实证研究，涉及从数据收集到模型训练的各个细节，最终开发出Phi-Ground模型家族。

Result: Phi-Ground模型家族在五个低于10B参数模型设置的定位基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。在端到端模型设置中，也取得了领先的结果。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Phi-Ground模型在五个基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，尤其是在ScreenSpot-pro和UI-Vision上的得分分别为43.2和27.2，推动GUI定位模型的发展。

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents
(CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI
grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to
mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure
of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as
related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end
grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging
benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from
being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable
consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of
grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training.
Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models
under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our
model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on
ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the
various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures,
not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other

Motivation: 解决使用稀疏视角视频进行动态场景重建的问题，因为现有的多视角方法需要昂贵且繁琐的设备，无法在自然场景中捕捉多样的场景。

Method: 将每个摄像头的独立单目重建精确对齐，从而生成时间和视角一致的动态场景重建。

Result: 在PanopticStudio和Ego-Exo4D上进行了广泛的实验，结果显示该方法在生成新视图时，比前人的方法实现了更高质量的重建。

Conclusion: 使用稀疏视角相机可以重新构建动态场景，并与现有的方法相比提供了更好的新视图重建质量。代码、数据和数据处理脚本也已公开发布。

Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view
videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of
calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are
prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.
In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a
bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene
coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that
dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view
setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,
we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to
produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive
experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method
achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when
rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on

Conclusion: 这个研究证明了概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）在分布变化下识别正确概念时存在困难。通过引入一个新的基准测试和生成方法，可以更严谨地评估这些模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models
show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is
essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that
CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution
shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce
SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic
images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33
bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific
concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied
Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where
noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the
correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel
benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models,
contributing to the development of more robust methods. Our code is available

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that
creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D
diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and
the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and
motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS
Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and
their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,
and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.
Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation
Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on
input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D
objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation
quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable
generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on
synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

TL;DR: 本文提出了大规模的PancreasDG数据集和一种半监督方法，用于改善胰腺分割中的领域泛化，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺分割在腹部影像学中仍然是一个主要挑战，因为胰腺较小、不规则，周围被器官和脂肪包围，并且T1对比度通常较低。此外，尽管胰腺在癌症早期检测、手术和糖尿病研究中的临床重要性，它在公共领域基准中仍然被系统性地低估。因此，需要一个专门的数据集来研究医学影像中的领域泛化问题。

Method: 本文提出了PancreasDG，一个大规模的多中心3D MRI胰腺分割数据集，用于研究医学影像中的领域泛化。该数据集包含来自六个机构的563份MRI扫描，涵盖静脉期和相位外序列，提供像素级准确的胰腺掩码。数据集的创建采用了双盲双重检查协议。通过全面分析，揭示了有关领域泛化的三个见解。作者还提出了一种半监督方法，利用解剖学不变性，显著优于最先进的领域泛化技术。

Result: 提出的半监督方法在两个测试中心的跨序列分割中获得了显著的性能提升，Dice评分提高了61.63%，达到87.00%。

Conclusion: PancreasDG为医学影像中的领域泛化设定了新的基准，并提出一种半监督方法在解决跨序列分割变异上取得了显著的效果。

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at

Conclusion: 该研究展示了异构卫星图像超分辨率的可行性，并为未来进展提供了关键的考虑因素。

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet
differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges
for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can
help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled
images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous
satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this
work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat
Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a
reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap
between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat
imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing
applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of
heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key
considerations for future advancements in the field.
