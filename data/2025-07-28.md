### [4] [Adapt, But Don't Forget: Fine-Tuning and Contrastive Routing for Lane Detection under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18653)
*Mohammed Abdul Hafeez Khan,Parth Ganeriwala,Sarah M. Lehman,Siddhartha Bhattacharyya,Amy Alvarez,Natasha Neogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种分支微调方法和动态路由机制，解决了车道检测跨数据集时灾难性遗忘的问题，效果卓越且参数高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观测到即便在同一领域中，跨数据集的分布转变也会导致微调过程中严重的灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 通过分析组件进行有效的微调策略，提出在基模型基础上创建分支，微调选定组件，同时保持原始分支不变。

Result: 所提出的框架在使用显著更少参数的情况下达到了接近最优的F1得分。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种方法，通过在输入推理时使用监督对比学习模型进行动态路由，来解决车道检测模型在跨数据集分布转变时可能出现的灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Lane detection models are often evaluated in a closed-world setting, where
training and testing occur on the same dataset. We observe that, even within
the same domain, cross-dataset distribution shifts can cause severe
catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. To address this, we first train a
base model on a source distribution and then adapt it to each new target
distribution by creating separate branches, fine-tuning only selected
components while keeping the original source branch fixed. Based on a
component-wise analysis, we identify effective fine-tuning strategies for
target distributions that enable parameter-efficient adaptation. At inference
time, we propose using a supervised contrastive learning model to identify the
input distribution and dynamically route it to the corresponding branch. Our
framework achieves near-optimal F1-scores while using significantly fewer
parameters than training separate models for each distribution.

### [5] [Part Segmentation of Human Meshes via Multi-View Human Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18655)
*James Dickens,Kamyar Hamad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法，通过伪标签生成和几何分割技术实现了大规模人类网格的语义分割，取得了有效的实验结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合点云深度学习与人体解析领域，目标是实现大规模人类网格的每个顶点的语义分割。

Method: 开发了一种伪标签生成管道，通过将网格与标准姿势对齐、从多个视角进行分割，并将结果回投到原始网格上生成伪标签。然后引入了一种基于空间填充曲线的窗口化迭代最远点采样的方法进行下采样，再利用PointTransformer进行几何分割。

Result: 该方法有效地实现了人类网格的语义解析，不依赖纹理信息，并取得了良好的实验结果。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，该方法在大规模人类网格的语义分割中是有效且精确的。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve
high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw
geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing
focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This
work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic
segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground
truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are
first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the
resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to
produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel,
memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest
point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to
effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric
segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes
without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the
effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.

### [6] [ShrinkBox: Backdoor Attack on Object Detection to Disrupt Collision Avoidance in Machine Learning-based Advanced Driver Assistance Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18656)
*Muhammad Zaeem Shahzad,Muhammad Abdullah Hanif,Bassem Ouni,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出ShrinkBox攻击，通过缩小边界框破坏机器学习ADAS系统的距离估计，攻击成功率高达96%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的高级驾驶辅助系统（ADAS）依赖昂贵的传感器技术（如LiDAR和雷达），这限制了其在低收入和中等收入国家的可及性。因此，提出了一种基于机器学习的ADAS（ML-ADAS）作为成本效益更高的替代方案。

Method: 文章介绍了一种名为ShrinkBox的新型后门攻击，专门针对碰撞规避ML-ADAS中的物体检测系统。与现有的攻击手法不同，ShrinkBox通过微缩真实边界框来达到目的，而不是操纵目标类别标签。

Result: ShrinkBox攻击在YOLOv9m对象检测器上实现时，能够达到96%的攻击成功率，训练实例中的中毒率仅为4%。此外，该攻击方法在被中毒样本的下游距离估计中，将平均绝对误差增加到原来的三倍以上。

Conclusion: ShrinkBox攻击可显著削弱 碰撞规避ML-ADAS的性能，尤其是在下游距离估计中。

Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) significantly enhance road safety
by detecting potential collisions and alerting drivers. However, their reliance
on expensive sensor technologies such as LiDAR and radar limits accessibility,
particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Machine learning-based ADAS
(ML-ADAS), leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) with only standard camera
input, offers a cost-effective alternative. Critical to ML-ADAS is the
collision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and
estimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs
like YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight,
detection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features
extracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size. However,
the robustness of these systems is undermined by security vulnerabilities in
object detectors. In this paper, we introduce ShrinkBox, a novel backdoor
attack targeting object detection in collision avoidance ML-ADAS. Unlike
existing attacks that manipulate object class labels or presence, ShrinkBox
subtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes. This attack remains undetected in
dataset inspections and standard benchmarks while severely disrupting
downstream distance estimation. We demonstrate that ShrinkBox can be realized
in the YOLOv9m object detector at an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96%, with
only a 4% poisoning ratio in the training instances of the KITTI dataset.
Furthermore, given the low error targets introduced in our relaxed poisoning
strategy, we find that ShrinkBox increases the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in
downstream distance estimation by more than 3x on poisoned samples, potentially
resulting in delays or prevention of collision warnings altogether.

### [7] [Closing the Modality Gap for Mixed Modality Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19054)
*Binxu Li,Yuhui Zhang,Xiaohan Wang,Weixin Liang,Ludwig Schmidt,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出GR-CLIP方法，解决了CLIP在混合模态搜索中的模态间隙问题，并在性能上显著超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合模态搜索是一个重要但研究不足的实际应用，涉及从由图像、文本和多模态文档组成的异构语料库中检索信息。

Method: 提出了一种轻量级的后验校准方法GR-CLIP，通过去除CLIP的嵌入空间中的模态间隙来解决问题。

Result: 在专为混合模态搜索设计的首个基准MixBench上，GR-CLIP在NDCG@10方面比CLIP提高了最多26个百分点，超过了近期的视觉-语言生成嵌入模型，同时计算量减少了75倍。

Conclusion: GR-CLIP能够有效解决CLIP在混合模态搜索任务中存在的模态间隙问题，提高检索性能。

Abstract: Mixed modality search -- retrieving information across a heterogeneous corpus
composed of images, texts, and multimodal documents -- is an important yet
underexplored real-world application. In this work, we investigate how
contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, perform on the mixed modality
search task. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: these models exhibit a
pronounced modality gap in the embedding space, where image and text embeddings
form distinct clusters, leading to intra-modal ranking bias and inter-modal
fusion failure. To address this issue, we propose GR-CLIP, a lightweight
post-hoc calibration method that removes the modality gap in CLIP's embedding
space. Evaluated on MixBench -- the first benchmark specifically designed for
mixed modality search -- GR-CLIP improves NDCG@10 by up to 26 percentage points
over CLIP, surpasses recent vision-language generative embedding models by 4
percentage points, while using 75x less compute.

### [8] [VGS-ATD: Robust Distributed Learning for Multi-Label Medical Image Classification Under Heterogeneous and Imbalanced Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18657)
*Zehui Zhao,Laith Alzubaidi,Haider A. Alwzwazy,Jinglan Zhang,Yuantong Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的分布式学习框架VGS-ATD，在解决医疗成像任务的隐私风险和扩展性方面表现突出，实验表明其效率和准确率均优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集中式学习存在严重的隐私问题，而现有的分散式学习方法在异构和不平衡数据下表现不佳，并且在动态复杂的临床环境下需要可扩展的AI系统。

Method: 提出了一个新的分布式学习框架VGS-ATD，通过分布式节点进行实验验证。

Result: VGS-ATD在分布式节点上的实验中实现了92.7%的整体准确率，超越集中式学习(84.9%)和群体学习(72.99%)，在扩展后仅出现1%的准确率下降，同时降低了计算成本至集中式和群体学习的一半。

Conclusion: VGS-ATD框架在分布式学习中表现优越，解决了异构和不平衡数据的问题，具有优越的扩展能力和效率。

Abstract: In recent years, advanced deep learning architectures have shown strong
performance in medical imaging tasks. However, the traditional centralized
learning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and
trained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized
approaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing
model training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these
methods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data
and suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the
aggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of
clinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously
learning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and
decentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system
expansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To
address these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning
framework. To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30
datasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved
an overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and
swarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions
due to high requirements on computational resources. VGS-ATD also demonstrated
strong scalability, with only a 1% drop in accuracy on existing nodes after
expansion, compared to a 20% drop in centralized learning, highlighting its
resilience to catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, it reduced computational
costs by up to 50% relative to both centralized and swarm learning, confirming
its superior efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Computer vision applications are omnipresent nowadays. The current paper
explores the use of fuzzy logic in computer vision, stressing its role in
handling uncertainty, noise, and imprecision in image data. Fuzzy logic is able
to model gradual transitions and human-like reasoning and provides a promising
approach to computer vision. Fuzzy approaches offer a way to improve object
recognition, image segmentation, and feature extraction by providing more
adaptable and interpretable solutions compared to traditional methods. We
discuss key fuzzy techniques, including fuzzy clustering, fuzzy inference
systems, type-2 fuzzy sets, and fuzzy rule-based decision-making. The paper
also discusses various applications, including medical imaging, autonomous
systems, and industrial inspection. Additionally, we explore the integration of
fuzzy logic with deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) to enhance performance in complex vision tasks. Finally, we examine
emerging trends such as hybrid fuzzy-deep learning models and explainable AI.

*Ruixing Zhang,Yang Zhang,Tongyu Zhu,Leilei Sun,Weifeng Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究通过视觉语言模型实现了更接近人类推理的轨迹推断，提出的方法在跨城市数据集上具有优越的性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数位置预测模型未能以人类推理的方式利用地图进行预测。因此，研究希望通过视觉语言模型来实现更接近人类推理的轨迹推断。

Method: 研究提出了一种名为Vision-Guided Location Search（VGLS）的方法，利用视觉语言模型在无需修改内部参数的情况下进行轨迹推理。接着，他们设计了两阶段的VLMLocPredictor模型，包括监督微调任务和从视觉地图反馈进行强化学习。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的方法，通过利用视觉语言模型来实现位置预测任务。实验结果表明，该方法不仅具有较高的准确性，还能够在不同城市之间表现出优越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human
mobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban
governance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to
predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory
on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However,
the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason
over maps \textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent
development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a
new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an
image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to
perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we
first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which
evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based
reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights
from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor,
which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and
trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual
inputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual
Map Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction
ability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on
datasets from four different cities show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city
generalization compared to other LLM-based approaches.

Conclusion: 在探讨用于自动化和增强嫌疑犯素描的多模态AI方法中，基线图像到图像的稳定扩散模型在结构相似性和信噪比方面表现最佳，尽管它简单但表现出色。

Abstract: This project investigates the use of multimodal AI-driven approaches to
automate and enhance suspect sketching. Three pipelines were developed and
evaluated: (1) baseline image-to-image Stable Diffusion model, (2) same model
integrated with a pre-trained CLIP model for text-image alignment, and (3)
novel approach incorporating LoRA fine-tuning of the CLIP model, applied to
self-attention and cross-attention layers, and integrated with Stable
Diffusion. An ablation study confirmed that fine-tuning both self- and
cross-attention layers yielded the best alignment between text descriptions and
sketches. Performance testing revealed that Model 1 achieved the highest
structural similarity (SSIM) of 0.72 and a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of
25 dB, outperforming Model 2 and Model 3. Iterative refinement enhanced
perceptual similarity (LPIPS), with Model 3 showing improvement over Model 2
but still trailing Model 1. Qualitatively, sketches generated by Model 1
demonstrated the clearest facial features, highlighting its robustness as a
baseline despite its simplicity.

Abstract: Human action recognition plays a critical role in healthcare and medicine,
supporting applications such as patient behavior monitoring, fall detection,
surgical robot supervision, and procedural skill assessment. While traditional
models like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle
to generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer
promising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In
this work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze
its performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and
shape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to
suppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only
class-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent
behavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual
cues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating
class-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce
attention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification
accuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a
discussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and
outline directions for future work to improve generalizability across
domain-independent healthcare scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HeartUnloadNet是一种新颖的深度学习框架，通过接收生理参数并采用循环一致性策略实现准确快速的无负荷左心室形状预测，支持未来实时临床应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏的无负荷几何结构在个性化生物力学建模中很重要，有助于理解健康和疾病状态下的生理情况，并预测心脏干预的效果。

Method: 引入HeartUnloadNet，这是一个深度学习框架，直接从舒张末期网格预测无负荷左心室形状，并明确纳入生物物理先验。网络接收任意大小的网格和生理参数，如舒张末期压力、心肌刚度比例和纤维螺旋方向，并输出对应的卸载网格。采用图注意力架构和循环一致性策略实现双向预测。

Result: HeartUnloadNet在20,700次有限元模拟中获得了亚毫米级的精度，平均DSC为0.986，HD为0.083厘米，推理时间仅为每例0.02秒，比传统FE逆求解器快10^5倍且更准确。循环一致性设计即使在只有200个训练样本时也能维持97%的DSC。

Conclusion: HeartUnloadNet提供了一种可扩展且准确的逆FE求解器替代方案，为未来的实时临床应用提供支持。

Abstract: The unloaded cardiac geometry (i.e., the state of the heart devoid of luminal
pressure) serves as a valuable zero-stress and zero-strain reference and is
critical for personalized biomechanical modeling of cardiac function, to
understand both healthy and diseased physiology and to predict the effects of
cardiac interventions. However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical
images remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on inverse
finite element (FE) solvers that require iterative optimization and are
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep
learning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape
directly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating
biophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with
physiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and
fiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts
a graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to
enable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial
self-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training
datasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV
geometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter
accuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing
inference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and
significantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the
cycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as
few as 200 training samples. This work thus presents a scalable and accurate
surrogate for inverse FE solvers, supporting real-time clinical applications in
the future.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is emerging as a transformative frontier in AI, yet it
remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. Unlike the
abundant 2D imagery, acquiring 3D data typically requires specialized sensors
and laborious annotation. In this work, we present a scalable pipeline that
converts single-view images into comprehensive, scale- and appearance-realistic
3D representations - including point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and
pseudo-RGBD - via integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale
calibration. Our method bridges the gap between the vast repository of imagery
and the increasing demand for spatial scene understanding. By automatically
generating authentic, scale-aware 3D data from images, we significantly reduce
data collection costs and open new avenues for advancing spatial intelligence.
We release two generated spatial datasets, i.e., COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D,
and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our generated data can
benefit various 3D tasks, ranging from fundamental perception to MLLM-based
reasoning. These results validate our pipeline as an effective solution for
developing AI systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting
with physical environments.

Conclusion: SaLF提出了一种新的体积表示法，支持栅格化和射线追踪，具有快速训练和高效渲染能力，适用于非针孔相机和旋转LiDAR传感器。与现有方法相比，提高了效率和功能，实现了更具规模的模拟。

Abstract: High-fidelity sensor simulation of light-based sensors such as cameras and
LiDARs is critical for safe and accurate autonomy testing. Neural radiance
field (NeRF)-based methods that reconstruct sensor observations via ray-casting
of implicit representations have demonstrated accurate simulation of driving
scenes, but are slow to train and render, hampering scale. 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated faster training and rendering times through
rasterization, but is primarily restricted to pinhole camera sensors,
preventing usage for realistic multi-sensor autonomy evaluation. Moreover, both
NeRF and 3DGS couple the representation with the rendering procedure (implicit
networks for ray-based evaluation, particles for rasterization), preventing
interoperability, which is key for general usage. In this work, we present
Sparse Local Fields (SaLF), a novel volumetric representation that supports
rasterization and raytracing. SaLF represents volumes as a sparse set of 3D
voxel primitives, where each voxel is a local implicit field. SaLF has fast
training (<30 min) and rendering capabilities (50+ FPS for camera and 600+ FPS
LiDAR), has adaptive pruning and densification to easily handle large scenes,
and can support non-pinhole cameras and spinning LiDARs. We demonstrate that
SaLF has similar realism as existing self-driving sensor simulation methods
while improving efficiency and enhancing capabilities, enabling more scalable
simulation. https://waabi.ai/salf/

TL;DR: 该论文改进了OMR方法，将suzipu的字符错误率降至7.1%，lülüpu降至0.9%，并超越了人类抄录的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史悠久的中国音乐符号（如suzipu和lülüpu）的光学音乐识别（OMR）面临独特挑战，如高类别不平衡和训练数据有限。

Method: 开发并评估了一个面向稀缺不平衡数据的字符识别模型，应用温度缩放技术来实现模型校准，并使用逐一版本交叉验证来确保性能的稳健性。

Result: 通过减少字符错误率（CER），suzipu的错误率从10.4%降至7.1%，lülüpu达到了显著的0.9%的错误率。模型性能超过了人类抄录者的平均错误率。

Conclusion: 研究促进了历史中国音乐的数字化和可访问性，推动了OMR在促进文化多样性和扩大其在代表性不足的音乐领域的应用。

Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for historical Chinese musical notations,
such as suzipu and l\"ul\"upu, presents unique challenges due to high class
imbalance and limited training data. This paper introduces significant
advancements in OMR for Jiang Kui's influential collection Baishidaoren Gequ
from 1202. In this work, we develop and evaluate a character recognition model
for scarce imbalanced data. We improve upon previous baselines by reducing the
Character Error Rate (CER) from 10.4% to 7.1% for suzipu, despite working with
77 highly imbalanced classes, and achieve a remarkable CER of 0.9% for
l\"ul\"upu. Our models outperform human transcribers, with an average human CER
of 15.9% and a best-case CER of 7.6%. We employ temperature scaling to achieve
a well-calibrated model with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) below 0.0162.
Using a leave-one-edition-out cross-validation approach, we ensure robust
performance across five historical editions. Additionally, we extend the
KuiSCIMA dataset to include all 109 pieces from Baishidaoren Gequ, encompassing
suzipu, l\"ul\"upu, and jianzipu notations. Our findings advance the
digitization and accessibility of historical Chinese music, promoting cultural
diversity in OMR and expanding its applicability to underrepresented music
traditions.

Conclusion: 这项研究通过构建大规模和高质量的SAR-Text数据集，有效提升了SAR图像在语义层面的理解，显著改进了图文检索、图像字幕生成和视觉问答等多项视觉-语言任务的性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the
field of remote sensing in recent years. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet
the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its
semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-Text, a large-scale and
high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To
construct the SAR-Text dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which
generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage progressive
transfer learning strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT
dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks:
image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA).
Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT:
SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable
improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 16.43% and
10.54% on the OSdataset-512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the
captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores exceeding
those of the original CoCa model by more than 8x, 4x, and 10x, respectively. In
the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple
SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning
ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that,
as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the
community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets.

Abstract: Modeling animatable human avatars from videos is a long-standing and
challenging problem. While conventional methods require per-instance
optimization, recent feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate 3D
Gaussians with a learnable network. However, these methods predict Gaussians
for each frame independently, without fully capturing the relations of
Gaussians from different timestamps. To address this, we propose Human Gaussian
Graph to model the connection between predicted Gaussians and human SMPL mesh,
so that we can leverage information from all frames to recover an animatable
human representation. Specifically, the Human Gaussian Graph contains dual
layers where Gaussians are the first layer nodes and mesh vertices serve as the
second layer nodes. Based on this structure, we further propose the intra-node
operation to aggregate various Gaussians connected to one mesh vertex, and
inter-node operation to support message passing among mesh node neighbors.
Experimental results on novel view synthesis and novel pose animation
demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method.

TL;DR: 本文提出ContourDiff架构，通过单目相机输入自我监督生成自由空间样本，使用扩散过程进行图像片段分布建模，能有效地预测可导航通道，性能在nuScenes和CARLA上得到验证。

Motivation: 现有的方法直接采用BEV（鸟瞰图）为基础的表示法进行通道估计，而这种表示很难获得。作者提出单纯基于图像感知任务来解决这一问题，使用单目相机输入，试图解决现有方法中的挑战。

Method: 作者提出一种自监督的方法生成自由空间样本，通过利用未来的自我轨迹和前视摄像机图像，使视觉通道估计依赖于自我轨迹。然后，采用扩散过程来模拟图像中这些片段的分布。并引入ContourDiff，一种基于扩散的架构，专注于通过轮廓点降噪而不是二进制掩膜表示，以实现结构化和可解释的自由空间预测。

Result: 在nuScenes和CARLA上的定性和定量评估结果显示，其方法有效地在图像中准确预测出安全的多模式可导航通道。

Conclusion: ContourDiff架构提供了一种更为结构化和可解释的自由空间预测方法，能够有效地解决现有通道估计方法的限制。

Abstract: Drivable Free-space prediction is a fundamental and crucial problem in
autonomous driving. Recent works have addressed the problem by representing the
entire non-obstacle road regions as the free-space. In contrast our aim is to
estimate the driving corridors that are a navigable subset of the entire road
region. Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a
BEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame
drivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using
only monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several
challenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space
corridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel
self-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future
ego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual
corridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion
process to model the distribution of such segments in the image. However, the
existing binary mask-based representation for a segment poses many limitations.
Therefore, we introduce ContourDiff, a specialized diffusion-based architecture
that denoises over contour points rather than relying on binary mask
representations, enabling structured and interpretable free-space predictions.
We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on both nuScenes and
CARLA, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting safe multimodal
navigable corridors in the image.

Motivation: 图像描述是一项需要理解视觉场景和语言结构的任务，而现代方法多由大型Transformer架构主导，本文旨在系统地开发基础图像描述模型。

Method: 本文提出了一系列五种模型，始于Genesis，最终为Nexus，该先进模型采用EfficientNetV2B3骨干和动态注意力机制进行图像描述任务实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，最终模型Nexus在MS COCO 2017数据集上实现了BLEU-4评分31.4，并超过多个基础基准，验证了架构改进的重要性。

Conclusion: 本研究通过系统迭代的方法发展了图像描述模型，并在经典的CNN-LSTM范式中发现了关键因素：在没有相应注意机制的情况下仅升级视觉主干会降低性能。最终模型Nexus实现了BLEU-4评分31.4，超过了一些基础基准，验证了设计过程的有效性。

Abstract: Image captioning, a task at the confluence of computer vision and natural
language processing, requires a sophisticated understanding of both visual
scenes and linguistic structure. While modern approaches are dominated by
large-scale Transformer architectures, this paper documents a systematic,
iterative development of foundational image captioning models, progressing from
a simple CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder to a competitive attention-based system. We
present a series of five models, beginning with Genesis and concluding with
Nexus, an advanced model featuring an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone and a dynamic
attention mechanism. Our experiments chart the impact of architectural
enhancements and demonstrate a key finding within the classic CNN-LSTM
paradigm: merely upgrading the visual backbone without a corresponding
attention mechanism can degrade performance, as the single-vector bottleneck
cannot transmit the richer visual detail. This insight validates the
architectural shift to attention. Trained on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, our
final model, Nexus, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, surpassing several
foundational benchmarks and validating our iterative design process. This work
provides a clear, replicable blueprint for understanding the core architectural
principles that underpin modern vision-language tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种使用面部标志而非图像处理的Deepfake检测方法，实验表明其在不同神经网络模型中具有高度准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的发展，现有技术在识别AI生成的媒体方面面临挑战，需要新方法来检测人工生成的媒体。

Method: 本文使用面部标志进行Deepfake检测，而不是直接图像处理，专注于面部运动中的微妙不一致。通过实验，测试了在三种不同的神经网络模型中使用相同的面部标志。

Result: 实验结果表明，面部标志特征提取技术在RNN和ANN模型中产生了96%到93%的准确率，而在CNN模型中约为78%。

Conclusion: 这项研究提出了一种通过面部标志检测Deepfake的有效方法，展示了面部特征提取在不同神经网络模型中的潜力，挑战了依赖图像处理识别Deepfake的传统做法。

Abstract: The rise of deepfake technology brings forth new questions about the
authenticity of various forms of media found online today. Videos and images
generated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more
difficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new
models to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted
to solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional
neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly
interacts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using
solely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of
both deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an
approach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on
identifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image
processing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction
technique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial
landmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance
metrics indicating its potential for real-world applications. The findings
discussed in this paper include RNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models
with accuracy between 96% and 93%, respectively, with a CNN model hovering
around 78%. This research challenges the assumption that raw image processing
is necessary to identify deepfake videos by presenting a facial feature
extraction approach compatible with various neural network models while
requiring fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Flow-SSN在医学影像领域取得了最佳效果。

Abstract: We introduce the Flow Stochastic Segmentation Network (Flow-SSN), a
generative segmentation model family featuring discrete-time autoregressive and
modern continuous-time flow variants. We prove fundamental limitations of the
low-rank parameterisation of previous methods and show that Flow-SSNs can
estimate arbitrarily high-rank pixel-wise covariances without assuming the rank
or storing the distributional parameters. Flow-SSNs are also more efficient to
sample from than standard diffusion-based segmentation models, thanks to most
of the model capacity being allocated to learning the base distribution of the
flow, constituting an expressive prior. We apply Flow-SSNs to challenging
medical imaging benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results. Code

TL;DR: PTCMIL是一种新的聚类和预测任务统一的MIL方法，通过提示标记减少复杂性，提高分类和生存分析任务的表现。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的多实例学习（MIL）方法在将多样的补丁信息聚合成强大的WSI表示方面面临挑战。ViT和基于聚类的方法具有潜力，但计算负担重，且无法捕捉任务特异性和幻灯片特异性的变异性。PTCMIL旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 通过在ViT主干中引入可学习的提示标记，PTCMIL实现了聚类和预测任务的端到端统一。它利用基于投影的聚类，根据每个WSI量身定制，并通过标记合并和基于原型的池化，减少复杂性，同时保留补丁异质性。

Conclusion: PTCMIL在多个数据集上的分类和生存分析任务中表现优异，并超过了当前最先进的方法。系统的消融研究确认了其稳健性和强大的可解释性。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has advanced WSI analysis but struggles with
the complexity and heterogeneity of WSIs. Existing MIL methods face challenges
in aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While
ViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally
intensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To
address these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token
Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt
tokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in
an end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks,
using projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity
while preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based
pooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive
experiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in
classification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong
interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.

TL;DR: 视觉自动语音识别面临音素模糊挑战，提出的两阶段音素框架，通过预测和重构音素提高识别准确性，显著降低词错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自动语音识别（V-ASR）任务面临挑战，主要由于缺乏声音线索和发音相近但视觉上类似的音素模糊。现有方法直接从视觉线索预测单词或字符，但误差率高且需大量预训练数据。

Method: 提出了一种基于音素的两阶段框架：第一阶段通过融合视觉和面部标志运动特征，预测音素，简化训练；第二阶段使用编码器-解码器LLM模型将音素重构为单词。利用大型视觉数据集进行深度学习微调。

Result: 在LRS2数据集上达到17.4%的词错误率（WER），在LRS3数据集上达到21.0%的词错误率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过音素预测减少训练复杂度，并通过重构将其转化为单词，从而在减少错误率且降低数据依赖方面表现优异。

Abstract: Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR) is a challenging task that
involves interpreting spoken language solely from visual information, such as
lip movements and facial expressions. This task is notably challenging due to
the absence of auditory cues and the visual ambiguity of phonemes that exhibit
similar visemes-distinct sounds that appear identical in lip motions. Existing
methods often aim to predict words or characters directly from visual cues, but
they commonly suffer from high error rates due to viseme ambiguity and require
large amounts of pre-training data. We propose a novel phoneme-based two-stage
framework that fuses visual and landmark motion features, followed by an LLM
model for word reconstruction to address these challenges. Stage 1 consists of
V-ASR, which outputs the predicted phonemes, thereby reducing training
complexity. Meanwhile, the facial landmark features address speaker-specific
facial characteristics. Stage 2 comprises an encoder-decoder LLM model, NLLB,
that reconstructs the output phonemes back to words. Besides using a large
visual dataset for deep learning fine-tuning, our PV-ASR method demonstrates
superior performance by achieving 17.4% WER on the LRS2 and 21.0% WER on the
LRS3 dataset.

Conclusion: MAT-Adv框架显著提高了对抗攻击的可迁移性和不可防御性，在多样化的模型和防御策略下仍然有效。

Abstract: Studying adversarial attacks on point clouds is essential for evaluating and
improving the robustness of 3D deep learning models. However, most existing
attack methods are developed under ideal white-box settings and often suffer
from limited transferability to unseen models and insufficient robustness
against common defense mechanisms. In this paper, we propose MAT-Adv, a novel
adversarial attack framework that enhances both transferability and
undefendability by explicitly perturbing the medial axis transform (MAT)
representations, in order to induce inherent adversarialness in the resulting
point clouds. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to project input point
clouds into compact MAT representations that capture the intrinsic geometric
structure of point clouds. By perturbing these intrinsic representations,
MAT-Adv introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics that remain
effective across diverse models and defense strategies. To mitigate overfitting
and prevent perturbation collapse, we incorporate a dropout strategy into the
optimization of MAT perturbations, further improving transferability and
undefendability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAT-Adv significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both transferability and
undefendability. Codes will be made public upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: 红外图像的对象检测在低光和夜间应用中至关重要，但由于大规模红外数据集的稀缺，模型依赖于在RGB图像上预训练的权重，这会导致在分布转移时的鲁棒性下降。

Method: 引入LLVIP-C和FLIR-C两个跨模态分布外（OOD）基准来评估方法。同时，提出WiSE-OD权重空间集成方法，其中有两个变体：WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$和WiSE-OD$_{LP}$。

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为WiSE-OD的方法，通过在权重空间进行结合，能够在不增加训练或推断成本的情况下提升跨模态与破损鲁棒性。

Abstract: Object detection (OD) in infrared (IR) imagery is critical for low-light and
nighttime applications. However, the scarcity of large-scale IR datasets forces
models to rely on weights pre-trained on RGB images. While fine-tuning on IR
improves accuracy, it often compromises robustness under distribution shifts
due to the inherent modality gap between RGB and IR. To address this, we
introduce LLVIP-C and FLIR-C, two cross-modality out-of-distribution (OOD)
benchmarks built by applying corruption to standard IR datasets. Additionally,
to fully leverage the complementary knowledge from RGB and infrared trained
models, we propose WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants:
WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$, which combines RGB zero-shot and IR fine-tuned weights, and
WiSE-OD$_{LP}$, which blends zero-shot and linear probing. Evaluated across
three RGB-pretrained detectors and two robust baselines, WiSE-OD improves both
cross-modality and corruption robustness without any additional training or
inference cost.

Conclusion: 通过三维几何先验的引入，所提出的方法可以在不增加计算负担的情况下改善定位成功率，并缩小模态差距。

Abstract: Since a building's floorplans are easily accessible, consistent over time,
and inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, self-localization within
the floorplan has attracted researchers' interest. However, since floorplans
are minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric
differences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this
task. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose
filters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization
errors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously
shaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan
Localization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric
priors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we
first model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,
i.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints
between multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the
view-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color
correspondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB
frames of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised
contrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are
required. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the
modal gap while improving localization success without increasing the
computational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
and substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy. All data and code will be released
after the anonymous review.

Motivation: 尽管预训练的视觉模型在文本方面表现出强大的视觉特征提取能力，但对贴纸情感的理解仍然具有挑战性，因为它需要依赖多视角信息，例如背景知识和风格线索。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的多粒度层次融合变压器（MGHFT），该变压器基于多模态大型语言模型具有多视角贴纸解释器。具体而言，受人类从多个视角解释贴纸情感的能力启发，首先使用多模态大型语言模型通过提供丰富的文本上下文进行多视角描述来解释贴纸。然后设计了一种层次融合策略，将文本上下文与视觉理解融合，在金字塔视觉变压器的基础上在多个阶段提取全局和局部贴纸特征。通过对比学习和注意力机制，在视觉主干的不同阶段注入文本特征，增强了全局和局部粒度视觉语义与文本指导的融合。最后，引入文本指导的融合注意力机制有效整合整体多模态特征，增强语义理解。

Result: 在两个公共贴纸情感数据集上的广泛实验表明，MGHFT显著优于现有贴纸情感识别方法，实现了更高的准确性和更细致的情感识别。与最好的预训练视觉模型相比，MGHFT在F1指标上提高了5.4%，准确率提高了4.0%。

Conclusion: MGHFT通过有效的多模态特征融合和增强视觉与文本语义理解，显著提高了贴纸情感识别的准确性和细粒度情感识别水平。

Abstract: Although pre-trained visual models with text have demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual feature extraction, sticker emotion understanding
remains challenging due to its reliance on multi-view information, such as
background knowledge and stylistic cues. To address this, we propose a novel
multi-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view
sticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,
inspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple
views, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by
providing rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a
hierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual
understanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both
global and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive
learning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different
stages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and
local-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce
a text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall
multimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on
2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly
outperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher
accuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best
pre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4%
on F1 and 4.0% on accuracy. The code is released at

Abstract: Underwater pollution is one of today's most significant environmental
concerns, with vast volumes of garbage found in seas, rivers, and landscapes
around the world. Accurate detection of these waste materials is crucial for
successful waste management, environmental monitoring, and mitigation
strategies. In this study, we investigated the performance of five cutting-edge
object recognition algorithms, namely YOLO (You Only Look Once) models,
including YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and Faster Region-Convolutional
Neural Network (R-CNN), to identify which model was most effective at
recognizing materials in underwater situations. The models were thoroughly
trained and tested on a large dataset containing fifteen different classes
under diverse conditions, such as low visibility and variable depths. From the
above-mentioned models, YOLOv8 outperformed the others, with a mean Average
Precision (mAP) of 80.9%, indicating a significant performance. This increased

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪装物体检测数据集稀缺，特别是在某些专业类别中，现有数据集难以满足需求。直接使用合成数据训练会造成模型性能下降。

Method: 提出了循环合成到真实域适应框架(CSRDA)，基于学生-教师模型，通过伪标签和一致性正则化将标签信息从源域传播到目标域，同时利用循环学习框架来缩小域内差距。

Result: 该方法通过缩小域内差距提高了伪标签质量，利用循环学习构建逐渐演化的真实域来连接源域和目标域，从而提升了模型的性能，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的任务S2R-COD，通过利用合成数据和有限的真实数据来改进伪装物体检测模型的性能。实验表明该框架有效缓解了数据不足和人工标注的困难。

Abstract: Due to the high cost of collection and labeling, there are relatively few
datasets for camouflaged object detection (COD). In particular, for certain
specialized categories, the available image dataset is insufficiently
populated. Synthetic datasets can be utilized to alleviate the problem of
limited data to some extent. However, directly training with synthetic datasets
compared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To
tackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely
Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD). In order to improve the
model performance in real world scenarios, a set of annotated synthetic
camouflaged images and a limited number of unannotated real images must be
utilized. We propose the Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework
(CSRDA), a method based on the student-teacher model. Specially, CSRDA
propagates class information from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled
target domain through pseudo labeling combined with consistency regularization.
Considering that narrowing the intra-domain gap can improve the quality of
pseudo labeling, CSRDA utilizes a recurrent learning framework to build an
evolving real domain for bridging the source and target domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, mitigating the
problem of limited data and handcraft annotations in COD. Our code is publicly

Motivation: 现有的视频对象分割模型在精确的掩码划分、可变形对象、拓扑变化对象、跟踪漂移和长视频序列等方面存在困难。

Method: HQ-SMem，该方法通过智能记忆增强VOS基础模型的性能。其主要创新包括：使用高质量掩码配合基于外貌的候选选择来精细化粗略的分割掩码；动态智能存储机制选择性存储关键帧以优化内存使用和处理效率；动态更新外貌模型以应对复杂拓扑的对象变化并减少视频中的漂移。

Conclusion: HQ-SMem改进了现有的VOS模型, 解决了背景像素混合、固定记忆更新、漂移和遮挡脆弱性以及SAM相关的提示模糊问题。

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is foundational to numerous computer vision
applications, including surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics and
generative video editing. However, existing VOS models often struggle with
precise mask delineation, deformable objects, topologically transforming
objects, tracking drift and long video sequences. In this paper, we introduce
HQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a
novel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing
these limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)
leveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based
candidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved
object boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that
selectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby
optimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and
(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex
topological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These
contributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including,
coarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update
schedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues
associated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public
datasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method
consistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets. Moreover,
HQ-SMem sets new benchmarks on Long Video Dataset and LVOS, showcasing its
effectiveness in challenging scenarios characterized by complex multi-object
dynamics over extended temporal durations.

Abstract: Rapid advances in medical imaging technology underscore the critical need for
precise and automated image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure diagnostic
accuracy. Existing medical IQA methods, however, struggle to generalize across
diverse modalities and clinical scenarios. In response, we introduce MedIQA,
the first comprehensive foundation model for medical IQA, designed to handle
variability in image dimensions, modalities, anatomical regions, and types. We
developed a large-scale multi-modality dataset with plentiful manually
annotated quality scores to support this. Our model integrates a salient slice
assessment module to focus on diagnostically relevant regions feature retrieval
and employs an automatic prompt strategy that aligns upstream physical
parameter pre-training with downstream expert annotation fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MedIQA significantly outperforms baselines in
multiple downstream tasks, establishing a scalable framework for medical IQA

*Zhentao Huang,Di Wu,Zhenbang He,Minglun Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSSR通过优化高斯分布和几何对齐，提升3DGS的几何重建精度和编辑效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3DGS方法中高斯不均匀分布导致的场景重建和编辑困难的问题。

Method: GSSR结合像素级和高斯级单视图法线一致性、多视图光度一致性以及不透明度正则化损失来优化几何对齐并重新初始化高斯分布。

Result: GSSR实现了显著提高的几何精确度，增强了场景编辑的直观性和新的3D环境生成效率。

Conclusion: GSSR在保持高质量渲染的同时，显著提升了几何精确度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) effectively synthesizes novel views through its
flexible representation, yet fails to accurately reconstruct scene geometry.
While modern variants like PGSR introduce additional losses to ensure proper
depth and normal maps through Gaussian fusion, they still neglect individual
placement optimization. This results in unevenly distributed Gaussians that
deviate from the latent surface, complicating both reconstruction refinement
and scene editing. Motivated by pioneering work on Point Set Surfaces, we
propose Gaussian Set Surface Reconstruction (GSSR), a method designed to
distribute Gaussians evenly along the latent surface while aligning their
dominant normals with the surface normal. GSSR enforces fine-grained geometric
alignment through a combination of pixel-level and Gaussian-level single-view
normal consistency and multi-view photometric consistency, optimizing both
local and global perspectives. To further refine the representation, we
introduce an opacity regularization loss to eliminate redundant Gaussians and
apply periodic depth- and normal-guided Gaussian reinitialization for a
cleaner, more uniform spatial distribution. Our reconstruction results
demonstrate significantly improved geometric precision in Gaussian placement,
enabling intuitive scene editing and efficient generation of novel
Gaussian-based 3D environments. Extensive experiments validate GSSR's
effectiveness, showing enhanced geometric accuracy while preserving
high-quality rendering performance.

Motivation: 如何从无结构的点云分布中提取有意义的结构信息，并将其转化为语义上有意义的点分布是一个未充分探索的问题。

Method: 采用了扩散模型的新颖架构和学习策略，通过去噪过程有效地关联起始和目标分布。

Conclusion: PDT框架能够成功地将输入点云转换为各种形式的结构化输出，展示了在3D几何处理中捕捉几何和语义特征的强大能力。

Abstract: Point-based representations have consistently played a vital role in
geometric data structures. Most point cloud learning and processing methods
typically leverage the unordered and unconstrained nature to represent the
underlying geometry of 3D shapes. However, how to extract meaningful structural
information from unstructured point cloud distributions and transform them into
semantically meaningful point distributions remains an under-explored problem.
We present PDT, a novel framework for point distribution transformation with
diffusion models. Given a set of input points, PDT learns to transform the
point set from its original geometric distribution into a target distribution
that is semantically meaningful. Our method utilizes diffusion models with
novel architecture and learning strategy, which effectively correlates the
source and the target distribution through a denoising process. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method successfully transforms input
point clouds into various forms of structured outputs - ranging from
surface-aligned keypoints, and inner sparse joints to continuous feature lines.
The results showcase our framework's ability to capture both geometric and
semantic features, offering a powerful tool for various 3D geometry processing
tasks where structured point distributions are desired. Code will be available

Result: 在四个MedMNIST数据集上的测试结果表明，MedSymmFlow在分类准确性和AUC上与现有基线相匹配或超过现有水平，并通过选择性预测时的性能提升验证了不确定性估计的可靠性。

Conclusion: MedSymmFlow模型在医学图像分类中能够达到甚至超过已有基线模型的分类准确性和AUC，同时还能提供可靠的不确定性估计。

Abstract: Reliable medical image classification requires accurate predictions and
well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, especially in high-stakes clinical
settings. This work presents MedSymmFlow, a generative-discriminative hybrid
model built on Symmetrical Flow Matching, designed to unify classification,
generation, and uncertainty quantification in medical imaging. MedSymmFlow
leverages a latent-space formulation that scales to high-resolution inputs and
introduces a semantic mask conditioning mechanism to enhance diagnostic
relevance. Unlike standard discriminative models, it naturally estimates
uncertainty through its generative sampling process. The model is evaluated on
four MedMNIST datasets, covering a range of modalities and pathologies. The
results show that MedSymmFlow matches or exceeds the performance of established
baselines in classification accuracy and AUC, while also delivering reliable
uncertainty estimates validated by performance improvements under selective
prediction.

Abstract: Given an object mask, Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (SVOS)
technique aims to track and segment the object across video frames, serving as
a fundamental task in computer vision. Although recent memory-based methods
demonstrate potential, they often struggle with scenes involving occlusion,
particularly in handling object interactions and high feature similarity. To
address these issues and meet the real-time processing requirements of
downstream applications, in this paper, we propose a novel bOundary Amendment
video object Segmentation method with Inherent Structure refinement, hereby
named OASIS. Specifically, a lightweight structure refinement module is
proposed to enhance segmentation accuracy. With the fusion of rough edge priors
captured by the Canny filter and stored object features, the module can
generate an object-level structure map and refine the representations by
highlighting boundary features. Evidential learning for uncertainty estimation
is introduced to further address challenges in occluded regions. The proposed
method, OASIS, maintains an efficient design, yet extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate its superior performance and competitive
inference speed compared to other state-of-the-art methods, i.e., achieving the
F values of 91.6 (vs. 89.7 on DAVIS-17 validation set) and G values of 86.6

Motivation: The development of CAD applications for apical periodontitis diagnosis is hindered by the absence of a large-scale, high-quality dataset, which this paper aims to address by releasing the PerioXrays benchmark.

Method: This study introduces PerioDet, which incorporates Background-Denoising Attention (BDA) and IoU-Dynamic Calibration (IDC) to enhance automated detection by overcoming challenges like background noise and small targets.

Result: The PerioDet method demonstrates excellent performance on the PerioXrays dataset, proving effective in automated detection and clinically applicable as an auxiliary diagnostic tool.

Conclusion: PerioDet, a new clinical-oriented apical periodontitis detection paradigm, shows superiority in automated detection on the PerioXrays dataset and has potential for use as an auxiliary tool for dentists.

Abstract: Apical periodontitis is a prevalent oral pathology that presents significant
public health challenges. Despite advances in automated diagnostic systems
across various medical fields, the development of Computer-Aided Diagnosis
(CAD) applications for apical periodontitis is still constrained by the lack of
a large-scale, high-quality annotated dataset. To address this issue, we
release a large-scale panoramic radiograph benchmark called "PerioXrays",
comprising 3,673 images and 5,662 meticulously annotated instances of apical
periodontitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark
dataset for automated apical periodontitis diagnosis. This paper further
proposes a clinical-oriented apical periodontitis detection (PerioDet)
paradigm, which jointly incorporates Background-Denoising Attention (BDA) and
IoU-Dynamic Calibration (IDC) mechanisms to address the challenges posed by
background noise and small targets in automated detection. Extensive

Motivation: 现有的点基和网格基方法存在无法有效建模人类运动动态的问题，因为它们未能平衡局部运动细节与长期时空依赖性，以及时间表示在建模轨迹序列时缺乏与频率域的交互。因此，需要一个能够统一时间域和频率域表示的轨迹预测方法。

Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and
robotics. While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two key
limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to
balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and
the time representation lacks interaction with the frequency domain in modeling
trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a
dynamic patch-based trajectory prediction framework that unifies time-domain
and frequency-domain representations. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory
into raw time sequences and frequency components, employing dynamic patch
partitioning for multi-scale trajectory segmentation to capture hierarchical
motion patterns. Each patch is processed by an adaptive embedding layer with
scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to
model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of two
branches interact via cross-modal attention, enabling complementary fusion of
temporal and spectral cues. Finally, a Transformer encoder-decoder integrates
both modalities to autoregressively predict future trajectories. Extensive
experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate identification of vehicle attributes such as make, colour, and shape
is critical for law enforcement and intelligence applications. This study
evaluates the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art deep learning approaches
YOLO-v11, YOLO-World, and YOLO-Classification on a real-world vehicle image
dataset. This dataset was collected under challenging and unconstrained
conditions by NSW Police Highway Patrol Vehicles. A multi-view inference (MVI)
approach was deployed to enhance the performance of the models' predictions. To
conduct the analyses, datasets with 100,000 plus images were created for each
of the three metadata prediction tasks, specifically make, shape and colour.
The models were tested on a separate dataset with 29,937 images belonging to
1809 number plates. Different sets of experiments have been investigated by
varying the models sizes. A classification accuracy of 93.70%, 82.86%, 85.19%,
and 94.86% was achieved with the best performing make, shape, colour, and
colour-binary models respectively. It was concluded that there is a need to use
MVI to get usable models within such complex real-world datasets. Our findings
indicated that the object detection models YOLO-v11 and YOLO-World outperformed
classification-only models in make and shape extraction. Moreover, smaller YOLO
variants perform comparably to larger counterparts, offering substantial
efficiency benefits for real-time predictions. This work provides a robust
baseline for extracting vehicle metadata in real-world scenarios. Such models
can be used in filtering and sorting user queries, minimising the time required

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的无训练归属方法，通过使用连续自动编码器的生成模型实现了较高的归属准确率，且计算成本极低。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image-generation technologies has made it possible
for anyone to create photorealistic images using generative models, raising
significant security concerns. To mitigate malicious use, tracing the origin of
such images is essential. Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a
promising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high
computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address
these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel
training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous
autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the
value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive
reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these
two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further
calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which
inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with
autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency.
Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5%
higher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while
requiring only 1% of the computational time.

TL;DR: LOTUS排行榜用于评估详细字幕显示没有模型在所有标准上表现突出，展示了字幕细节与偏见风险之间的相关性，选择模型取决于用户优先事项。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估缺乏标准化标准、偏见意识评估和用户偏好考量。

Method: 引入LOTUS排行榜，评估详细字幕。

Result: 通过针对用户优先级的评估，展示了最佳模型选择取决于用户的优先事项。

Conclusion: 没有单一模型能够在所有标准上表现突出，同时在描述细节和偏见风险之间存在相关性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have transformed image captioning,
shifting from concise captions to detailed descriptions. We introduce LOTUS, a
leaderboard for evaluating detailed captions, addressing three main gaps in
existing evaluations: lack of standardized criteria, bias-aware assessments,
and user preference considerations. LOTUS comprehensively evaluates various
aspects, including caption quality (e.g., alignment, descriptiveness), risks
(\eg, hallucination), and societal biases (e.g., gender bias) while enabling
preference-oriented evaluations by tailoring criteria to diverse user
preferences. Our analysis of recent LVLMs reveals no single model excels across
all criteria, while correlations emerge between caption detail and bias risks.
Preference-oriented evaluations demonstrate that optimal model selection
depends on user priorities.

TL;DR: 提出一种统一的点级提示方法，通过重新定义去噪和补全为提示机制，展示了在处理低质量点云数据时的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现实场景中常出现的掩蔽和3D传感器数据不佳，点云质量通常较低，现有方法通过开发专门的去噪和补全模型来提高点云质量。这些方法在点云增强和下游任务之间的孤立导致其在各种真实领域中无法有效发挥作用。同时，去噪和补全任务之间的目标冲突进一步限制了保留关键几何特征的集合范式。

Method: 提出一种统一的点级提示方法，重新定义点云去噪和补全为提示机制。首先介绍矫正提示器，通过预测矫正矢量提示来适应噪声点，有效过滤噪声并保留复杂的几何特征；然后结合补全提示器，根据矫正后的点云生成辅助点提示，以增强其稳健性和适应性；最后利用形状感知单元模块高效统一和捕获滤波后的几何特征以进行下游点云分析。

Result: 四个数据集上的广泛实验表明，与现有先进方法相比，该方法在处理噪声和不完整点云数据时表现出优越性和稳健性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过提出一种统一的点级提示方法解决了噪声和不完整点云处理中去噪与补全任务冲突的问题，并在多个数据集上的实验中表现出卓越的分析能力。

Abstract: Pre-trained point cloud analysis models have shown promising advancements in
various downstream tasks, yet their effectiveness is typically suffering from
low-quality point cloud (i.e., noise and incompleteness), which is a common
issue in real scenarios due to casual object occlusions and unsatisfactory data
collected by 3D sensors. To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point
cloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,
due to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,
these methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the
conflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the
ensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above
challenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates
point cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust
analysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a
Rectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted
rectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving
intricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we
further incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts
based on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and
adaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently
unify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point
cloud analysis.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
superiority and robustness of our method when handling noisy and incomplete
point cloud data against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
released at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/ICCV2025-UPP.

TL;DR: MMBench-GUI是一个用于评估GUI自动化代理的分层基准框架，强调视觉定位、任务规划及效率提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能全面评估GUI自动化代理性能的基准测试框架，以识别关键的视觉定位因素及促进自动化代理的效率提升。

Method: 引入了MMBench-GUI作为评测框架，包含GUI内容理解、元素定位、任务自动化和任务协作四个层级。同时提出了效率-质量区域（EQA）度量，用于评估GUI代理在在线自动化场景中的执行效率。

Result: 确定了准确视觉定位是任务成功的关键因素，当前模型在任务效率方面存在显著不足。为实现高效和可扩展的GUI自动化，需要精确的定位、有效的规划和早停止策略。

Conclusion: MMBench-GUI提供了一个全面且分层的评测框架，用于评估GUI自动化代理的任务效率与质量。通过该基准，我们发现精确的视觉定位对于任务的成功至关重要，并强调集成专业定位模块的模块化框架的优势。为了实现可靠的GUI自动化，代理需要强大的任务规划和跨平台通用能力。

Abstract: We introduce MMBench-GUI, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating GUI
automation agents across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web
platforms. It comprises four levels: GUI Content Understanding, Element
Grounding, Task Automation, and Task Collaboration, covering essential skills
for GUI agents. In addition, we propose a novel Efficiency-Quality Area (EQA)
metric to assess GUI agent execution efficiency in online automation scenarios.
Through MMBench-GUI, we identify accurate visual grounding as a critical
determinant of overall task success, emphasizing the substantial benefits of
modular frameworks that integrate specialized grounding modules. Furthermore,
to achieve reliable GUI automation, an agent requires strong task planning and
cross-platform generalization abilities, with long-context memory, a broad
action space, and long-term reasoning playing a critical role. More important,
task efficiency remains a critically underexplored dimension, and all models
suffer from substantial inefficiencies, with excessive redundant steps even
when tasks are ultimately completed. The integration of precise localization,
effective planning, and early stopping strategies is indispensable to enable
truly efficient and scalable GUI automation. Our benchmark code, evaluation
data, and running environment will be publicly available at
https://github.com/open-compass/MMBench-GUI.

*Yongsong Huang,Tomo Miyazaki,Xiaofeng Liu,Shinichiro Omachi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的红外图像超分辨率架构GPSMamba，通过语义频率提示和非因果监督提升了图像恢复性能，实验验证了其领先的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外图像通常存在低对比度和稀疏纹理，需要强大的长程建模能力来保持全局一致性。然而，现有的状态空间模型（如Mamba）因其1D因果扫描机制而在恢复细节上表现不足。

Method: 提出了一种新的红外图像超分辨率方案，名为GPSMamba。通过自适应语义频率状态空间模块(ASF-SSM)和新型的热光谱注意力及相位一致性损失，实现了非因果监督和全局上下文整合。

Result: 实验结果表明，GPSMamba在红外图像恢复的表现上达到了最新的技术水平。

Conclusion: 本文提出的GPSMamba框架通过全局相位和光谱提示引导Mamba，成功解决了红外图像超分辨率中的长期依赖建模问题，显著提高了模型性能。

Abstract: Infrared Image Super-Resolution (IRSR) is challenged by the low contrast and
sparse textures of infrared data, requiring robust long-range modeling to
maintain global coherence. While State-Space Models like Mamba offer
proficiency in modeling long-range dependencies for this task, their inherent
1D causal scanning mechanism fragments the global context of 2D images,
hindering fine-detail restoration. To address this, we propose Global Phase and
Spectral Prompt-guided Mamba (GPSMamba), a framework that synergizes
architectural guidance with non-causal supervision. First, our Adaptive
Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused
semantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local
context to guide reconstruction. Then, a novel Thermal-Spectral Attention and
Phase Consistency Loss provides explicit, non-causal supervision to enforce
global structural and spectral fidelity. By combining these two innovations,
our work presents a systematic strategy to mitigate the limitations of causal
modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSMamba achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating our approach as a powerful new
paradigm for infrared image restoration. Code is available at

Motivation: 提高室外3D物体检测的准确性，融合LiDAR和RGB数据。

Method: 提出了一个名为多流检测（MuStD）的网络，结合LiDAR和RGB数据的多模态流来准确提取任务相关信息，并通过一个三流结构来实现。

Result: 在KITTI Object Detection Benchmark的挑战中取得了新的最先进或高度竞争性的结果。

Conclusion: 通过MuStD网络融合LiDAR和RGB数据，能够显著提高室外3D物体检测的准确性。

Abstract: Fusion of LiDAR and RGB data has the potential to enhance outdoor 3D object
detection accuracy. To address real-world challenges in outdoor 3D object
detection, fusion of LiDAR and RGB input has started gaining traction. However,
effective integration of these modalities for precise object detection task
still remains a largely open problem. To address that, we propose a MultiStream
Detection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information
from both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure. Its
LiDAR-PillarNet stream extracts sparse 2D pillar features from the LiDAR input
while the LiDAR-Height Compression stream computes Bird's-Eye View features. An
additional 3D Multimodal stream combines RGB and LiDAR features using UV
mapping and polar coordinate indexing. Eventually, the features containing
comprehensive spatial, textural and geometric information are carefully fused
and fed to a detection head for 3D object detection. Our extensive evaluation

TL;DR: 新的评估模型改善了图像和文本对齐度及图像美学评分，推进了图像生成技术的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估框架未能跟上图像生成系统的进展，偏向于错误评分不符合人类审美偏好的高细节和高美学价值图像。

Method: 设计一种新的评估分数ICT（图片含文本）分数，并训练HP（高偏好）分数模型，仅使用图像模态来增强图像美学和细节质量，同时保持文本图像对齐。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的评估模型相比现有方法提高了超过10%的评分准确性，并显著优化了最先进的文本到图像模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为图像生成技术向更高阶的人类审美偏好演进提供了理论和实证支持。

Abstract: Contemporary image generation systems have achieved high fidelity and
superior aesthetic quality beyond basic text-image alignment. However, existing
evaluation frameworks have failed to evolve in parallel. This study reveals
that human preference reward models fine-tuned based on CLIP and BLIP
architectures have inherent flaws: they inappropriately assign low scores to
images with rich details and high aesthetic value, creating a significant
discrepancy with actual human aesthetic preferences. To address this issue, we
design a novel evaluation score, ICT (Image-Contained-Text) score, that
achieves and surpasses the objectives of text-image alignment by assessing the
degree to which images represent textual content. Building upon this
foundation, we further train an HP (High-Preference) score model using solely
the image modality to enhance image aesthetics and detail quality while
maintaining text-image alignment. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
evaluation model improves scoring accuracy by over 10\% compared to existing
methods, and achieves significant results in optimizing state-of-the-art
text-to-image models. This research provides theoretical and empirical support
for evolving image generation technology toward higher-order human aesthetic
preferences. Code is available at https://github.com/BarretBa/ICTHP.

TL;DR: SIDE通过训练和修剪方案改善原型部分的可解释性，保持准确性的同时大幅减少了解释复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域（如医学成像和自动驾驶），理解深度神经网络所做出的决策至关重要。然而，这些模型通常缺乏透明性，特别是在计算机视觉方面。原型部分基础的神经网络以概念层次解释提供了一种有前途的解决方案，但大多数仅限于细粒度分类任务，少数例外如InfoDisent将其扩展到了大型数据集，但产生了复杂的解释。

Method: 介绍一种新颖的方法---稀疏信息解耦以增强可解释性（SIDE），通过专用的训练和修剪方案来提高原型部分的可解释性，并通过使用sigmoid激活函数替代softmax来加强稀疏性。

Result: SIDE与现有方法的准确性相匹配，同时将解释大小减少了90%以上，显著增强了基于原型的解释的可理解性。

Conclusion: 通过减少解释大小并提高解释的简洁性，SIDE改进了原型部分的可解释性，同时保持了与现有方法相当的准确性。

Abstract: Understanding the decisions made by deep neural networks is essential in
high-stakes domains such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Yet, these
models often lack transparency, particularly in computer vision.
Prototypical-parts-based neural networks have emerged as a promising solution
by offering concept-level explanations. However, most are limited to
fine-grained classification tasks, with few exceptions such as InfoDisent.
InfoDisent extends prototypical models to large-scale datasets like ImageNet,
but produces complex explanations.
  We introduce Sparse Information Disentanglement for Explainability (SIDE), a
novel method that improves the interpretability of prototypical parts through a
dedicated training and pruning scheme that enforces sparsity. Combined with
sigmoid activations in place of softmax, this approach allows SIDE to associate
each class with only a small set of relevant prototypes. Extensive experiments
show that SIDE matches the accuracy of existing methods while reducing
explanation size by over $90\%$, substantially enhancing the understandability
of prototype-based explanations.

Result: 综述了幻觉评估基准、检测方法，并指出其局限性与未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 针对当前MLLMs中基于基准检测幻觉生成的不足，提供实例级检测的方法作为补充。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm
for integrating visual and textual information, supporting a wide range of
multi-modal tasks. However, these models often suffer from hallucination,
producing content that appears plausible but contradicts the input content or
established world knowledge. This survey offers an in-depth review of
hallucination evaluation benchmarks and detection methods across Image-to-Text
(I2T) and Text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. Specifically, we first propose
a taxonomy of hallucination based on faithfulness and factuality, incorporating
the common types of hallucinations observed in practice. Then we provide an
overview of existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks for both T2I and I2T
tasks, highlighting their construction process, evaluation objectives, and
employed metrics. Furthermore, we summarize recent advances in hallucination
detection methods, which aims to identify hallucinated content at the instance
level and serve as a practical complement of benchmark-based evaluation.
Finally, we highlight key limitations in current benchmarks and detection
methods, and outline potential directions for future research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的OSFL框架，通过FG-RF和DLKD方法提高训练效率和隐私保护，实验表现优于传统多轮方法和FedISCA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型为基础的OSFL方法在医疗保健领域的训练效率低、隐私泄露风险高，且在非独立同分布数据下难以在单轮模型聚合中收敛。

Method: 提出了一个改进的OSFL框架，开发了一种新的特征引导校正流模型（FG-RF）和双层知识蒸馏（DLKD）聚合方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，改进框架和方法在三个非IID医疗影像数据集上比多轮联邦学习方法表现更好，性能提高可达21.73%，超过基线FedISCA平均21.75%。同时，特征级合成图像相比像素级合成图像显著降低隐私泄露风险。

Conclusion: 本文提出的改进OSFL框架在医疗图像场景中提升了生成建模效率，同时通过合成特征级图像保护了隐私，DLKD方法则有效处理了非独立同分布数据，提高了模型聚合的收敛性。

Abstract: In multi-center scenarios, One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) has attracted
increasing attention due to its low communication overhead, requiring only a
single round of transmission. However, existing generative model-based OSFL
methods suffer from low training efficiency and potential privacy leakage in
the healthcare domain. Additionally, achieving convergence within a single
round of model aggregation is challenging under non-Independent and Identically
Distributed (non-IID) data. To address these challenges, in this paper a
modified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified
Flow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation
method are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling
in medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing
feature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID
distributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic
the output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side
teacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID
medical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform
multi-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement,
and exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that feature-level synthetic images significantly
reduce privacy leakage risks compared to pixel-level synthetic images.

TL;DR: 研究开发了新的脑编码模型，通过严格测试发现简单模型在分布外数据上表现更佳，语言特征没有提高预测准确性。分布外测试对构建鲁棒模型重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测自然多模态刺激对大脑活动的影响是计算神经科学的重要挑战。虽然编码模型越来越强大，但其在真实新环境中泛化的能力仍然是一个关键且通常未经测试的问题。

Method: 使用最新的视觉（X-CLIP）和听觉（Whisper）特征提取器来开发大脑编码模型，并对其进行严格的评估，使用包含分布内（ID）和分布外（OOD）数据。

Result: 复杂度较高的注意力模型在分布内数据上表现出色，但简单的线性模型在分布外数据上更具鲁棒性，表现超出基线模型18%。语言特征没有提高预测准确性，而连续的视觉和听觉信息占主导地位。大脑听觉皮层中的性能显著提升，证实了高保真语音表示的益处。

Conclusion: 严格的分布外测试对于构建鲁棒的神经AI模型至关重要，并提供了关于模型架构、刺激特性和感官层级如何影响大脑对丰富的多模态世界编码的深刻见解。

Abstract: Predicting brain activity in response to naturalistic, multimodal stimuli is
a key challenge in computational neuroscience. While encoding models are
becoming more powerful, their ability to generalize to truly novel contexts
remains a critical, often untested, question. In this work, we developed brain
encoding models using state-of-the-art visual (X-CLIP) and auditory (Whisper)
feature extractors and rigorously evaluated them on both in-distribution (ID)
and diverse out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our results reveal a fundamental
trade-off between model complexity and generalization: a higher-capacity
attention-based model excelled on ID data, but a simpler linear model was more
robust, outperforming a competitive baseline by 18\% on the OOD set.
Intriguingly, we found that linguistic features did not improve predictive
accuracy, suggesting that for familiar languages, neural encoding may be
dominated by the continuous visual and auditory streams over redundant textual
information. Spatially, our approach showed marked performance gains in the
auditory cortex, underscoring the benefit of high-fidelity speech
representations. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that rigorous OOD
testing is essential for building robust neuro-AI models and provides nuanced
insights into how model architecture, stimulus characteristics, and sensory
hierarchies shape the neural encoding of our rich, multimodal world.

Motivation: 当前的视觉-语言模型（如CLIP）虽然能够有效地进行零样本分类，但在处理长尾分布的类时性能显著下降。为了解决这一问题，提高对稀有类的识别和分类准确性，我们提出了新的方法。

Method: 我们的方法引入了一种类权重机制，直接与潜在空间中的类分布对齐。具体技术包括对潜在空间进行高斯混合模型(GMM)聚类，然后通过Student t分布进行进一步细化，并使用度量损失优化嵌入特征。

Result: 采用我们的方法后，在MIMIC-CXR-JPG数据集上的零样本AUC得分平均提高了7个百分点。特别是在长尾类的识别上取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 我们的研究表明，通过引入基于类权重机制的方法，可以显著提升对长尾类的识别准确性，将平均零样本AUC得分提高了7个百分点。

Abstract: Chest radiography (CXR) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various
diseases. However, the inherent class imbalance in the distribution of clinical
findings presents a significant challenge for current self-supervised deep
learning models. These models often fail to accurately classify long-tailed
classes. Current Vision-Language models such as Contrastive Language Image
Pre-training (CLIP) models effectively model the manifold distribution of the
latent space, enabling high zero-shot classification accuracies. Although CLIP
performs well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals
that its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed
distribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly
aligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method
ensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with
particular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely
observed classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
clustering to the latent space. The subsequent clusters are further refined by
Student t-distribution, followed by a metric loss that utilizes the altered
embeddings. Our approach facilitates stable and adaptive clustering of the
features. This results in a notable average improvement of 7\% points in
zero-shot AUC scores across 40 classes in the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset from
previous SOTA models.

Motivation: 解决现有3D场景生成方法中，由于扩展视图的累计偏差导致的语义漂移问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的框架ScenePainter，通过SceneConceptGraph这一层次化图结构来构建多级场景概念之间的关系，引导外部绘制模块生成一致性的新的视图，并可动态调整以增强多样性。

Result: 实验表明，ScenePainter能够生成更加一致和沉浸式的3D视图序列，克服了语义漂移问题。

Conclusion: ScenePainter框架可以有效解决现有方法中的语义漂移问题，生成更加连贯和沉浸的3D视图序列。

Abstract: Perpetual 3D scene generation aims to produce long-range and coherent 3D view
sequences, which is applicable for long-term video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction. Existing methods follow a "navigate-and-imagine" fashion and
rely on outpainting for successive view expansion. However, the generated view
sequences suffer from semantic drift issue derived from the accumulated
deviation of the outpainting module. To tackle this challenge, we propose
ScenePainter, a new framework for semantically consistent 3D scene generation,
which aligns the outpainter's scene-specific prior with the comprehension of
the current scene. To be specific, we introduce a hierarchical graph structure
dubbed SceneConceptGraph to construct relations among multi-level scene
concepts, which directs the outpainter for consistent novel views and can be
dynamically refined to enhance diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework overcomes the semantic drift issue and generates more
consistent and immersive 3D view sequences. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Transformer的小目标检测器由于特征金字塔网络中的噪声敏感性和标签分配策略中的查询质量下降而面临挑战。

Method: 提出了一种新的噪声弹性查询优化（NRQO）范式，结合了噪声容忍特征金字塔网络（NT-FPN）和成对相似区域提案网络（PS-RPN）。

Result: NT-FPN通过保留空间和语义信息完整性来缓解FPN中的噪声。PS-RPN则通过位置和形状相似性来增强锚点与真实值的匹配，生成高质量的正查询。

Conclusion: NRQO在对比实验中表现优于现有最先进的基线方法，在多个基准测试上展现出了优越的性能。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Transformer-based detectors for small object
detection (SOD), recent studies show that these detectors still face challenges
due to inherent noise sensitivity in feature pyramid networks (FPN) and
diminished query quality in existing label assignment strategies. In this
paper, we propose a novel Noise-Resilient Query Optimization (NRQO) paradigm,
which innovatively incorporates the Noise-Tolerance Feature Pyramid Network
(NT-FPN) and the Pairwise-Similarity Region Proposal Network (PS-RPN).
Specifically, NT-FPN mitigates noise during feature fusion in FPN by preserving
spatial and semantic information integrity. Unlike existing label assignment
strategies, PS-RPN generates a sufficient number of high-quality positive
queries by enhancing anchor-ground truth matching through position and shape
similarities, without the need for additional hyperparameters. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of
NRQO over state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NEAT, a method improving negation understanding in VLMs without relying on large-scale data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of negation understanding in Vision-Language Models, which is not adequately handled by current models due to the scarcity of negation training data.

Method: The Negation-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method is proposed to adjust distribution-related parameters during inference, tackling the dual-concept shifts inherent in negation.

Result: NEAT effectively reduces distributional shift related to negation through parameter adjustment at inference, verified through extensive experiments on various tasks.

Conclusion: NEAT method proves effective in handling negation understanding in VLMs, reducing distributional shift without requiring extensive data and computational resources.

Abstract: In this paper, we study a practical but less-touched problem in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), \ie, negation understanding. Specifically, many
real-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or
non-existent, \eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific
conditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale
training, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation.
To address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the
scarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive
data containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions
demand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable
widespread adoption. To tackle negation in a low-carbon manner, we empirically
observe that the key obstacle lies in the dual-concept shifts between the
affirmation and negation distributions. Therefore, we propose a Negation-Aware
Test-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method to efficiently adjust distribution-related
parameters during inference. In brief, NEAT can reduce distribution shift in
consistent semantics while eliminating false distributional consistency in
unrelated semantics. Extensive experiments on the various negation
understanding tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code
is available at https://github.com/hhc1997/NEAT.

*Yangyang Xu,Bangzhen Liu,Wenqi Shao,Yong Du,Shengfeng He,Tingting Zhu*

TL;DR: 提出了一种双向自动编码器框架，通过语义细化和视觉一致性模块提高解码精度，优于现有方法，并对新主体具有良好的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨主体映射上存在困难，这是由于认知变化和主体特定差异造成的，这会导致顺序错误，从而累积误差，降低重建保真度。

Method: 提出了双向自动编码器交织框架，通过主体偏差调制模块统一多个主体，并利用双向映射更好地捕捉数据分布，以实现精确的表示预测。为了在解码表示为刺激图像时进一步提高保真度，引入了语义细化模块和视觉一致性模块。该方法集成了ControlNet和Stable Diffusion。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在基准数据集上的表现优于现有的最新方法，并能够在定性和定量评估中取得更好的效果。此外，该框架对新的主体具有很强的适应性，仅需少量训练样本。

Abstract: Decoding stimulus images from fMRI signals has advanced with pre-trained
generative models. However, existing methods struggle with cross-subject
mappings due to cognitive variability and subject-specific differences. This
challenge arises from sequential errors, where unidirectional mappings generate
partially inaccurate representations that, when fed into diffusion models,
accumulate errors and degrade reconstruction fidelity. To address this, we
propose the Bidirectional Autoencoder Intertwining framework for accurate
decoded representation prediction. Our approach unifies multiple subjects
through a Subject Bias Modulation Module while leveraging bidirectional mapping
to better capture data distributions for precise representation prediction. To
further enhance fidelity when decoding representations into stimulus images, we
introduce a Semantic Refinement Module to improve semantic representations and
a Visual Coherence Module to mitigate the effects of inaccurate visual
representations. Integrated with ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Moreover, our framework exhibits
strong adaptability to new subjects with minimal training samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的CNN和transformer方法在医学异常检测中存在局限性，因此需要一种新的模型来处理这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为SP-Mamba的空间感知Mamba框架，通过窗口滑动原型学习和基于Circular-Hilbert扫描的Mamba技术来进行无监督医学异常检测。

Conclusion: SP-Mamba框架在捕捉医学影像的一致性结构方面表现出色，提供了一种线性计算效率高的替代方案，可用于医学异常检测。

Abstract: Radiography imaging protocols target on specific anatomical regions,
resulting in highly consistent images with recurrent structural patterns across
patients. Recent advances in medical anomaly detection have demonstrated the
effectiveness of CNN- and transformer-based approaches. However, CNNs exhibit
limitations in capturing long-range dependencies, while transformers suffer
from quadratic computational complexity. In contrast, Mamba-based models,
leveraging superior long-range modeling, structural feature extraction, and
linear computational efficiency, have emerged as a promising alternative. To
capitalize on the inherent structural regularity of medical images, this study
introduces SP-Mamba, a spatial-perception Mamba framework for unsupervised
medical anomaly detection. The window-sliding prototype learning and
Circular-Hilbert scanning-based Mamba are introduced to better exploit
consistent anatomical patterns and leverage spatial information for medical
anomaly detection. Furthermore, we excavate the concentration and contrast
characteristics of anomaly maps for improving anomaly detection. Extensive
experiments on three diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks confirm the
proposed method's state-of-the-art performance, validating its efficacy and
robustness. The code is available at https://github.com/Ray-RuiPan/SP-Mamba.

Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）在密集预测中表现出色，但在共享表示与任务专用之间的平衡方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 引入了一种创新的细粒度专家混合（FGMoE）架构，通过三种关键创新和微调探索基于MoE的MTL模型。

Result: FGMoE使用较少的参数，并且在两个密集预测数据集NYUD-v2和PASCAL-Context的各种指标上显著优于当前基于MoE的MTL模型。

Conclusion: 通过引入新颖的架构和方法，FGMoE显著提高了密集预测任务的性能，同时改善了参数效率。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) for dense prediction has shown promising results
but still faces challenges in balancing shared representations with
task-specific specialization. In this paper, we introduce a novel Fine-Grained
Mixture of Experts (FGMoE) architecture that explores MoE-based MTL models
through a combination of three key innovations and fine-tuning. First, we
propose intra-task experts that partition along intermediate hidden dimensions
of MLPs, enabling finer decomposition of task information while maintaining
parameter efficiency. Second, we introduce shared experts that consolidate
common information across different contexts of the same task, reducing
redundancy, and allowing routing experts to focus on unique aspects. Third, we
design a global expert that facilitates adaptive knowledge transfer across
tasks based on both input feature and task requirements, promoting beneficial
information sharing while preventing harmful interference. In addition, we use
the fine-tuning approach to improve parameter efficiency only by training the
parameters of the decoder. Extensive experimental results show that the
proposed FGMoE uses fewer parameters and significantly outperforms current
MoE-based competitive MTL models on two dense prediction datasets
(\textit{i.e.,} NYUD-v2, PASCAL-Context) in various metrics.

TL;DR: LISA方法可以有效减少多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中的对象幻觉，并提高生成一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言任务时容易出现对象幻觉，LISA旨在减少这种现象并提高模型的稳定性和精准度。

Method: LISA采用层次调制和多层融合的方式来增强信息生成的一致性。具体方法包括区域特定的频谱调制和基于锚点的软logit融合。

Result: 实验表明，LISA在多个基准测试中将对象幻觉减少了53.6%，并且POPE F1提升了4.5%，展示了其在各种模型和任务中的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: LISA显著减少了多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中的对象幻觉现象，并提高了整体生成一致性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks such
as image captioning but remain prone to object hallucinations, where they
describe objects that do not appear in the image. To mitigate this, we propose
\textbf{LISA}, a \textbf{L}ayer-wise \textbf{I}ntegration and
\textbf{S}uppression \textbf{A}pproach that enhances generation consistency
through hierarchical modulation and multi-layer fusion. LISA leverages the
functional hierarchy within MLLMs, where shallow layers provide visual
grounding, middle layers encode semantics, and deep layers tend to amplify
spurious signals. First, zone-specific spectral modulation stabilizes attention
by suppressing over-amplified activations in deeper layers while preserving
alignment cues in earlier layers. Second, token-level logits from selected
layers are fused via anchor-based routing, with token-wise anchor selection and
soft logit fusion enabling adaptive integration during decoding. LISA is fully
\textbf{plug-and-play} and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs,
including Qwen2.5-VL. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that LISA reduces
hallucinations by up to 53.6\% in $\mathrm{CHAIR}_I$ and improves POPE F1 by
4.5\%, demonstrating strong generalization across models and tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的跨模态图像匹配机制CSTF，结合软最大和卷积网络，使特征匹配更高效和精确，在目标检测任务中表现优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要在全连接层提取特征，但通常不能有效捕捉跨模态的相似性，因此需要一种能够在几何和辐射差异显著的多模态遥感图像间进行有效匹配的特征描述方法。

Method: 提出了一种跨空间时间融合（CSTF）机制，通过在参考图像和查询图像中独立检测尺度不变的关键点来增强特征表示，并利用SoftMax和全卷积网络（FCN）层将相似性匹配过程重新表述为分类任务。

Result: 在HRSC2016和DOTA基准数据集上进行目标检测任务评估，CSTF方法在HRSC2016上实现了90.99%平均mAP，在DOTA上实现了90.86%，优于现有模型，并且推理速度达到12.5 FPS。

Conclusion: CSTF模型在生产效率和精度上优于现有模型，实现了跨模态图像的稳健匹配，从而提高了遥感应用中的目标检测性能。

Abstract: Effectively describing features for cross-modal remote sensing image matching
remains a challenging task due to the significant geometric and radiometric
differences between multimodal images. Existing methods primarily extract
features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal
similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF)
mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant
keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our
approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating
correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions
simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as
a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)
layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive
local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in
robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the
practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object
detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method
achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016
and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains
computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results
validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances
downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.

TL;DR: TopGeoFormer通过整合拓扑和几何特征，使用先进的 attention 机制和损失函数，显著改善了点云采样和恢复的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点云恢复方法无法有效利用拓扑和几何属性。

Method: 我们提出了一种名为TopGeoFormer的端到端架构。首先，通过连续映射邻近点之间相对关系的方法，获取拓扑嵌入，并在采样和恢复阶段集成这些嵌入。其次，提出InterTwining Attention机制，实现拓扑与几何嵌入的充分融合。最后，引入全几何损失和拓扑约束损失来优化嵌入。

Result: 我们的方法在定量和定性结果上都表现出显著的优越性。

Conclusion: 我们的TopGeoFormer方法显著优于现有的采样和恢复方法。

Abstract: Recovering point clouds involves the sequential process of sampling and
restoration, yet existing methods struggle to effectively leverage both
topological and geometric attributes. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
architecture named \textbf{TopGeoFormer}, which maintains these critical
features throughout the sampling and restoration phases. First, we revisit
traditional feature extraction techniques to yield topological embedding using
a continuous mapping of relative relationships between neighboring points, and
integrate it in both phases for preserving the structure of the original space.
Second, we propose the \textbf{InterTwining Attention} to fully merge
topological and geometric embeddings, which queries shape with local awareness
in both phases to form a learnable shape context facilitated with point-wise,
point-shape-wise, and intra-shape features. Third, we introduce a full geometry
loss and a topological constraint loss to optimize the embeddings in both
Euclidean and topological spaces. The geometry loss uses inconsistent matching
between coarse-to-fine generations and targets for reconstructing better
geometric details, and the constraint loss limits embedding variances for
better approximation of the topological space. In experiments, we
comprehensively analyze the circumstances using the conventional and
learning-based sampling/upsampling algorithms. The quantitative and qualitative
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing sampling
and recovery methods.

TL;DR: MixA-Q框架通过在窗口内利用激活稀疏性，为量化视觉变压器的推理带来了显著的效率提升，且不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过探索激活剪枝中广泛研究的稀疏性，在量化视觉变压器的推理效率中提高性能与效率之间的平衡。

Method: MixA-Q利用窗口内激活稀疏性，将较低位宽分配给不重要的窗口激活，同时通过引入双分支Swin块，使低位和高位的激活分别进行处理，从而提高效率。

Result: 在COCO数据集上的实验显示，MixA-Q在PTQ配置中实现了训练无关的1.35倍计算加速且不损失精度；在QAT配置中实现了无损失的1.25倍加速，并通过结合激活剪枝达到1.53倍加速，mAP仅下降1%。此外，通过减少重要区域的量化误差，MixA-Q提高了W4A4模型的量化后mAP 0.7%，减少了量化退化24%。

Conclusion: MixA-Q在不影响精度的情况下显著提高了窗口型视觉变压器的推理效率，尤其是在PTQ和QAT配置中，能够实现1.35倍和1.25倍的速度提升，并在结合激活剪枝时将速度提升至1.53倍。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose MixA-Q, a mixed-precision activation quantization
framework that leverages intra-layer activation sparsity (a concept widely
explored in activation pruning methods) for efficient inference of quantized
window-based vision transformers. For a given uniform-bit quantization
configuration, MixA-Q separates the batched window computations within Swin
blocks and assigns a lower bit width to the activations of less important
windows, improving the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We
introduce a Two-Branch Swin Block that processes activations separately in
high- and low-bit precision, enabling seamless integration of our method with
most quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods, or with simple modifications. Our experimental evaluations over the
COCO dataset demonstrate that MixA-Q achieves a training-free 1.35x
computational speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ configuration. With QAT,
MixA-Q achieves a lossless 1.25x speedup and a 1.53x speedup with only a 1% mAP
drop by incorporating activation pruning. Notably, by reducing the quantization
error in important regions, our sparsity-aware quantization adaptation improves
the mAP of the quantized W4A4 model (with both weights and activations in 4-bit
precision) by 0.7%, reducing quantization degradation by 24%.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的原型-亲和力混合网络（PAHNet）方法，以在少样本分割任务中平衡现有方法的保守性和激进性，从而提升分割性能。

Abstract: This paper studies the few-shot segmentation (FSS) task, which aims to
segment objects belonging to unseen categories in a query image by learning a
model on a small number of well-annotated support samples. Our analysis of two
mainstream FSS paradigms reveals that the predictions made by prototype
learning methods are usually conservative, while those of affinity learning
methods tend to be more aggressive. This observation motivates us to balance
the conservative and aggressive information captured by these two types of FSS
frameworks so as to improve the segmentation performance. To achieve this, we
propose a **P**rototype-**A**ffinity **H**ybrid **Net**work (PAHNet), which
introduces a Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) module and an Attention
Score Calibration (ASC) module in each attention block of an affinity learning
model (called affinity learner). These two modules utilize the predictions
generated by a pre-trained prototype learning model (called prototype
predictor) to enhance the foreground information in support and query image
representations and suppress the mismatched foreground-background (FG-BG)
relationships between them, respectively. In this way, the aggressiveness of
the affinity learner can be effectively mitigated, thereby eventually
increasing the segmentation accuracy of our PAHNet method. Experimental results
show that PAHNet outperforms most recently proposed methods across 1-shot and
5-shot settings on both PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, suggesting its
effectiveness. The code is available at: [GitHub - tianyu-zou/PAHNet: Balancing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DASH is a new framework for dynamic scene rendering using 4D hash encoding and self-supervised decomposition, achieving high visual quality and real-time speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the low-rank constraints causing feature overlap in dynamic Gaussian splatting and hash collisions in 4D hash encoding when applied to entire dynamic scenes.

Method: DASH employs 4D hash encoding with self-supervised decomposition, multiresolution 4D hash encoding for dynamic elements, and spatio-temporal smoothness regularization.

Result: Enhanced visual quality at real-time speeds of 264 FPS on a single 4090 GPU.

Conclusion: DASH achieves state-of-the-art dynamic rendering performance with enhanced visual quality and real-time processing speed.

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in 3D vision. Existing
plane-based methods in dynamic Gaussian splatting suffer from an unsuitable
low-rank assumption, causing feature overlap and poor rendering quality.
Although 4D hash encoding provides an explicit representation without low-rank
constraints, directly applying it to the entire dynamic scene leads to
substantial hash collisions and redundancy. To address these challenges, we
present DASH, a real-time dynamic scene rendering framework that employs 4D
hash encoding coupled with self-supervised decomposition. Our approach begins
with a self-supervised decomposition mechanism that separates dynamic and
static components without manual annotations or precomputed masks. Next, we
introduce a multiresolution 4D hash encoder for dynamic elements, providing an
explicit representation that avoids the low-rank assumption. Finally, we
present a spatio-temporal smoothness regularization strategy to mitigate
unstable deformation artifacts. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that DASH achieves state-of-the-art dynamic rendering performance, exhibiting
enhanced visual quality at real-time speeds of 264 FPS on a single 4090 GPU.

Conclusion: 引入重叠补丁嵌入可以在保持吞吐量的情况下提高性能。

Abstract: Multi-head self-attention is a distinctive feature extraction mechanism of
vision transformers that computes pairwise relationships among all input
patches, contributing significantly to their high performance. However, it is
known to incur a quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number
of patches. One promising approach to address this issue is patch pruning,
which improves computational efficiency by identifying and removing redundant
patches. In this work, we propose a patch pruning strategy that evaluates the
importance of each patch based on the variance of attention weights across
multiple attention heads. This approach is inspired by the design of multi-head
self-attention, which aims to capture diverse attention patterns across
different subspaces of feature representations. The proposed method can be
easily applied during both training and inference, and achieves improved
throughput while maintaining classification accuracy in scenarios such as
fine-tuning with pre-trained models. In addition, we also found that using
robust statistical measures, such as the median absolute deviation in place of
variance, to assess patch importance can similarly lead to strong performance.
Furthermore, by introducing overlapping patch embeddings, our method achieves
better performance with comparable throughput to conventional approaches that
utilize all patches.

Conclusion: 本文提出的连续学习方法为多种天气条件下的图像恢复提供了统一的框架，展示出在标准基准数据集上的显著性能提升。

Abstract: Restoration of images contaminated by different adverse weather conditions
such as fog, snow, and rain is a challenging task due to the varying nature of
the weather conditions. Most of the existing methods focus on any one
particular weather conditions. However, for applications such as autonomous
driving, a unified model is necessary to perform restoration of corrupted
images due to different weather conditions. We propose a continual learning
approach to propose a unified framework for image restoration. The proposed
framework integrates three key innovations: (1) Selective Kernel Fusion layers
that dynamically combine global and local features for robust adaptive feature
selection; (2) Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to enable continual learning
and mitigate catastrophic forgetting across multiple restoration tasks; and (3)
a novel Cycle-Contrastive Loss that enhances feature discrimination while
preserving semantic consistency during domain translation. Further, we propose
an unpaired image restoration approach to reduce the dependance of the proposed
approach on the training data. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark
datasets for dehazing, desnowing and deraining tasks demonstrate significant
improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality over the state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该论文旨在解决现有单目语义场景完成方法中的特征纠结和几何不一致问题。

Method: VisHall3D框架将场景完成任务分解为两个阶段：第一个阶段通过VisFrontierNet准确地追踪视觉前沿，同时保留细粒度的细节；第二个阶段通过OcclusionMAE生成不可见区域的合理几何。

Result: VisHall3D在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360两个基准上进行了广泛实验，结果显示其在性能上优于现有的方法。

Conclusion: VisHall3D有效地解决了特征纠结和几何不一致的问题，在一个阶段进行可见区域的重建，而在另一个阶段生成不可见区域的合理几何。实验表明，VisHall3D在挑战性基准上超过了现有的方法，改进了重建质量。

Abstract: This paper introduces VisHall3D, a novel two-stage framework for monocular
semantic scene completion that aims to address the issues of feature
entanglement and geometric inconsistency prevalent in existing methods.
VisHall3D decomposes the scene completion task into two stages: reconstructing
the visible regions (vision) and inferring the invisible regions
(hallucination). In the first stage, VisFrontierNet, a visibility-aware
projection module, is introduced to accurately trace the visual frontier while
preserving fine-grained details. In the second stage, OcclusionMAE, a
hallucination network, is employed to generate plausible geometries for the
invisible regions using a noise injection mechanism. By decoupling scene
completion into these two distinct stages, VisHall3D effectively mitigates
feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency, leading to significantly
improved reconstruction quality.
  The effectiveness of VisHall3D is validated through extensive experiments on
two challenging benchmarks: SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360. VisHall3D
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a
significant margin and paves the way for more accurate and reliable scene
understanding in autonomous driving and other applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CounterNet的网络，通过改进3D点云数据中的物体计数精度，提高查询结果的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶车辆生成了大量的点云数据，但用于特定任务如碰撞检测、交通分析或拥堵监测的相关数据仅仅是其中的一小部分。有效查询这些数据对于实现针对性的分析至关重要。而准确的物体计数是查询执行的重要组成部分。现有的研究主要集中在2D视频数据的索引技术，而在3D点云数据中，最先进的检测模型往往不能生成可靠的物体计数，导致查询结果出现大量错误。

Method: 提出了一种名为CounterNet的基于热图的网络，用于在大规模点云数据中实现准确的物体计数。CounterNet通过找到物体中心来提高计数精度，而不是关注物体定位。此外，通过使用重叠区域的特征图划分策略，来增强其在复杂交通场景中处理大小物体的性能。同时引入了每帧动态模型选择策略，以选择针对每个输入最有效的配置。

Result: 在三个真实世界自动驾驶车辆数据集上的评估结果表明，CounterNet在物体类别上的计数精度提高了5%到20%，从而使所有支持的查询类型产生更可靠的查询结果。

Conclusion: CounterNet通过改进计数精度解决了现有模型在3D点云数据中产生错误的限制，改善了查询结果的可靠性。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles generate massive volumes of point cloud data, yet only a
subset is relevant for specific tasks such as collision detection, traffic
analysis, or congestion monitoring. Effectively querying this data is essential
to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying
by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each
aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on
accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object
counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on
indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide
accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data,
state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object
counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this
limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for
accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing
on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding
object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance
with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling
better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To
adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model
selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each
input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that
CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories,

TL;DR: 该研究通过引入SPA-ADV数据集和PRE-MAP模型，解决了主观认知多样性对视觉注意力的影响, 并通过强化学习优化和一致性策略保证预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型和数据集主要忽略了主观认知多样性对注视行为的影响。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的眼动跟踪显著性预测模型PRE-MAP，通过强化学习优化的眼动跟踪来表征个性化视觉差异，并通过一致性群体相对政策优化（C-GRPO）确保预测点格式正确且空间精准。

Result: 在大量实验中验证了该方法的有效性。该代码和数据集已经开放获取。

Conclusion: 通过新的数据集和方法有效地捕捉和预测了个性化的视觉注意力模式。

Abstract: Visual selective attention, driven by individual preferences, regulates human
prioritization of visual stimuli by bridging subjective cognitive mechanisms
with objective visual elements, thereby steering the semantic interpretation
and hierarchical processing of dynamic visual scenes. However, existing models
and datasets predominantly neglect the influence of subjective cognitive
diversity on fixation behavior. Conventional saliency prediction models,
typically employing segmentation approaches, rely on low-resolution imagery to
generate saliency heatmaps, subsequently upscaled to native resolutions, which
limiting their capacity to capture personalized attention patterns.
Furthermore, MLLMs are constrained by factors such as hallucinations, making it
very costly to strictly adhere to the expected format in tasks involving
multiple point predictions, and achieving precise point positioning is
challenging. To address these limitations, we present Subjective Personalized
Attention for Advertisement Videos, namely SPA-ADV, a large-scale multimodal
dataset capturing gaze behaviors from over 4,500 participants varying in age
and gender with 486 videos. Furthermore, we propose PRE-MAP, a novel
eye-tracking saliency model that characterizes Personalized visual disparities
through Reinforcement learning-optimized Eye-tracking, built upon MLLMs and
guided by Multi-Attribute user profiles to predict Points. To ensure MLLMs
produce prediction points that are both format-correct and spatially accurate,
we introduce Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), inspired
by the variability in eye movement points and Multi-Attribute profiles.
Extensive experiments on SPA-ADV and other benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 提出一个利用大型语言模型生成多人体动作的框架，可有效捕捉场景上下文，并提供基准测试以评估其扩展性与多样性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成多人体的上下文动作需要全面推理人际及人与场景互动中的动态关系。我们是首个从规模和多样性方面解决此问题的框架，旨在创建生动的虚拟动态场景。

Method: 我们利用大型语言模型(LLM)的能力分析文本输入中的上下文复杂性，并将任务转化为具体的子问题，以生成超越以往规模的多主体行为。首先，我们的事件生成器将动态场景的时间演变构建为一系列小事件。接下来，根据空间指导生成角色的位置，并综合角色动作。高层模块负责提供可扩展且全面的上下文，将事件翻译为相对描述以检索精确坐标。

Result: 基准测试结果及用户研究表明，我们的框架能够以高扩展性有效捕捉场景上下文。

Conclusion: 代码和基准测试、结果视频可在项目页面获取，证明框架能够高效地解决生成生动虚拟动态场景的问题。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a framework that creates a lively virtual dynamic
scene with contextual motions of multiple humans. Generating multi-human
contextual motion requires holistic reasoning over dynamic relationships among
human-human and human-scene interactions. We adapt the power of a large
language model (LLM) to digest the contextual complexity within textual input
and convert the task into tangible subproblems such that we can generate
multi-agent behavior beyond the scale that was not considered before.
Specifically, our event generator formulates the temporal progression of a
dynamic scene into a sequence of small events. Each event calls for a
well-defined motion involving relevant characters and objects. Next, we
synthesize the motions of characters at positions sampled based on spatial
guidance. We employ a high-level module to deliver scalable yet comprehensive
context, translating events into relative descriptions that enable the
retrieval of precise coordinates. As the first to address this problem at scale
and with diversity, we offer a benchmark to assess diverse aspects of
contextual reasoning. Benchmark results and user studies show that our
framework effectively captures scene context with high scalability. The code

TL;DR: CoopTrack是一个用于合作跟踪的端到端框架，通过学习实例关联和稀疏特征传输提高感知能力，在V2X-Seq上有领先表现。


<details>

Motivation: 之前的研究主要集中在单帧感知任务上，对更具挑战性的合作顺序感知任务如合作3D多对象跟踪的研究不足。

Method: CoopTrack提供了一个完全实例级的端到端框架，具有可学习的实例关联，并传输稀疏的实例级特征。它有两个关键组成部分：多维特征提取和跨代理关联与聚合。

Result: CoopTrack在V2X-Seq和Griffin数据集上进行了实验，并显示出优异的性能，特别是在V2X-Seq上取得了最新的结果，分别是39.0%的mAP和32.8%的AMOTA。

Conclusion: CoopTrack在V2X-Seq数据集上达到了39.0% mAP和32.8% AMOTA的领先表现。

Abstract: Cooperative perception aims to address the inherent limitations of
single-vehicle autonomous driving systems through information exchange among
multiple agents. Previous research has primarily focused on single-frame
perception tasks. However, the more challenging cooperative sequential
perception tasks, such as cooperative 3D multi-object tracking, have not been
thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we propose CoopTrack, a fully
instance-level end-to-end framework for cooperative tracking, featuring
learnable instance association, which fundamentally differs from existing
approaches. CoopTrack transmits sparse instance-level features that
significantly enhance perception capabilities while maintaining low
transmission costs. Furthermore, the framework comprises two key components:
Multi-Dimensional Feature Extraction, and Cross-Agent Association and
Aggregation, which collectively enable comprehensive instance representation
with semantic and motion features, and adaptive cross-agent association and
fusion based on a feature graph. Experiments on both the V2X-Seq and Griffin
datasets demonstrate that CoopTrack achieves excellent performance.
Specifically, it attains state-of-the-art results on V2X-Seq, with 39.0\% mAP
and 32.8\% AMOTA. The project is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 针对多模态场景中的3D深度异常检测困难，提出了一种新的统一多模态异常检测框架，通过异常生成和共享参数实现更高效的检测，实验结果显示性能优于SOTA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工业异常检测中，检测3D深度异常一直是难点，因为仅靠2D信息不足以准确表征3D信息。尤其是在多模态场景中，由于不同模态信息之间的差异，使得深度信息的提取和表示变得尤其困难。此外，在工业数据中，特别是在多模态场景中，异常样本较为稀缺，因此需要进行异常生成以模拟真实世界中的异常样本。

Method: 提出了一种新的统一多模态异常检测框架，利用3D点云数据提取可见深度信息，用2D RGB图像表示外观，并采用Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly Generator和Unified Texture Anomaly Generator生成丰富的RGB和深度异常，同时所有模块共享参数以有效连接2D和3D异常检测。

Result: 实验结果显示，我们的方法在MVTec-3D AD和Eyecandies数据集上优于最新的SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 新框架成功解决了3D深度异常检测的难题，通过统一的多模态异常生成和共享的参数架构提供了更加高效的异常检测方案。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection for 2D objects has gained significant attention
and achieved progress in anomaly detection (AD) methods. However, identifying
3D depth anomalies using only 2D information is insufficient. Despite
explicitly fusing depth information into RGB images or using point cloud
backbone networks to extract depth features, both approaches struggle to
adequately represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios due to the
disparities among different modal information. Additionally, due to the
scarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal
scenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world
abnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly
detection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key
aspects. (1) We extract visible depth information from 3D point cloud data
simply and use 2D RGB images to represent appearance, which disentangles depth
and appearance to support unified anomaly generation. (2) Benefiting from the
flexible input representation, the proposed Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly
Generator and Unified Texture Anomaly Generator can generate richer anomalies
in RGB and depth. (3) All modules share parameters for both RGB and depth data,
effectively bridging 2D and 3D anomaly detection. Subsequent modules can
directly leverage features from both modalities without complex fusion.
Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVTec-3D AD
and Eyecandies datasets. Code available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的评估长图像描述真实度的方法，OV-Fact，通过开放词汇量视觉定位和工具验证，解决了传统方法的不足，并可用于事实性数据过滤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型在生成长的、真实的图像描述方面存在困难，传统的真实度衡量方法对于评估长而多样的图像描述并不适用，尤其是在人类标注的真实数据不可用时。

Method: OV-Fact利用开放词汇量视觉定位和工具验证来评估长图像描述的真实度，无需依赖人工标注。

Result: 使用OVFact过滤的子集进行训练的模型，在长图像描述的事实性精度方面有显著提高，同时不影响描述性。

Conclusion: 新方法OV-Fact提高了生成长图像描述的准确性和真实度衡量标准，实现了无需参考的、基于事实的数据过滤。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate long and
factual captions. However, traditional measures for hallucination and
factuality are not well suited for evaluating longer, more diverse captions and
in settings where ground-truth human-annotated captions are unavailable. We
introduce OV-Fact, a novel method for measuring caption factuality of long
captions that leverages open-vocabulary visual grounding and tool-based
verification without depending on human annotations. Our method improves
agreement with human judgments and captures both caption descriptiveness
(recall) and factual precision in the same metric. Furthermore, unlike previous
metrics, our reference-free method design enables new applications towards
factuality-based data filtering. We observe models trained on an
OVFact-filtered (2.5-5x less) subset of a large-scale, noisy (VLM-generated)
pretraining set meaningfully improve factuality precision without sacrificing
caption descriptiveness across a range of downstream long caption benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的多模态学习方法依赖复杂的网络结构或数据填补技术，而SimMLM旨在提供一种简单而有效的解决方案，适应不同的模态缺失场景，并提高准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: SimMLM采用了一种通用的动态模态专家混合（DMoME）架构，具有一个动态的、可学习的门控机制，能够自动调整每种模态在完整和部分模态设置中的贡献。此外，SimMLM提出了一种更多与更少（MoFe）排名损失，以确保在更多模态可用时任务准确性提高或保持稳定。

Result: 在BraTS 2018多模态医学图像分割和UPMC Food-101、avMNIST多模态分类任务上验证了SimMLM，其在测试时不断超越现有方法。

Conclusion: SimMLM在多模态医学图像分割和多模态分类任务上表现出优越的准确性、可解释性、鲁棒性和可靠性，超越了现有的竞争方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SimMLM, a simple yet powerful framework for
multimodal learning with missing modalities. Unlike existing approaches that
rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation
techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to
various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness.
Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts
(DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that
automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial
modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer
(MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains
stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an
intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase
accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS
2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it
consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy,
interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing
modality scenarios at test time.

Motivation: 现有的自监督学习方法大多在静态图像上训练，未能利用视频中固有的时间线索，因此该研究提出了利用视频信息来增强图像编码器的方法。

Method: 引入了一种视频蒸馏的单图像编码器，训练其通过当前帧预测下一帧的表示，从而注入3D空间和时间先验，且不需要光流或跟踪。

Result: 在使用单个2小时视频进行预训练后，该方法在ADE20K数据集上的平均交并比（mIoU）从35.0提高到36.4，且完全能替代仅使用图像的管道。

Conclusion: 视频自蒸馏是一种轻量级的方法，可以通过注入3D空间和时间先验来增强图像编码器的能力，提高对物理可行世界模型和物理人工智能的感知。

Abstract: Self-supervised image encoders such as DINO have recently gained significant
interest for learning robust visual features without labels. However, most SSL
methods train on static images and miss the temporal cues inherent in videos.
We introduce a video-distilled single-image encoder trained to predict the
next-frame representation from the current frame. This simple objective injects
3D spatial and temporal priors without optical flow or tracking. When
pre-training on a single 2-hour video, our approach raises the mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) on ADE20K from 35.0 (DoRA) to 36.4 while
remaining a drop-in replacement for image-only pipelines. Our results highlight
video self-distillation as a lightweight route to geometry-aware perception an
essential ingredient for physically plausible world models and Physical AI.

TL;DR: RemoteReasoner, a MLLM-based workflow with RL, offers autonomous, versatile reasoning solutions in remote sensing, outperforming traditional methods and introducing new capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an Earth observation workflow capable of autonomously interpreting complex queries involving spatial context and user intent, beyond traditional supervised model constraints.

Method: The RemoteReasoner system utilizes a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) combined with reinforcement learning (RL) to autonomously handle reasoning tasks. This is achieved without predefined reasoning paths or supervised fine-tuning, and includes strategies for various output formats.

Result: Experiments show that RemoteReasoner significantly outperforms existing methods in multi-granular reasoning tasks, enabling new functions like contour extraction.

Conclusion: RemoteReasoner exhibits remarkable performance across multi-granular reasoning tasks, offering novel capabilities not achievable with existing methods.

Abstract: Remote sensing imagery presents vast, inherently unstructured spatial data,
demanding sophisticated reasoning to interpret complex user intents and
contextual relationships beyond simple recognition tasks. In this paper, we aim
to construct an Earth observation workflow to handle complex queries by
reasoning about spatial context and user intent. As a reasoning workflow, it
should be somewhat autonomous, where predefined ground-truth reasoning paths do
not constrain the learning process. Furthermore, its architecture ought to be
unified yet flexible, enabling the model to perform diverse reasoning tasks
with distinct output formats through a single forward pass. Existing remote
sensing approaches fail to address these requirements, as they rely on
supervised fine-tuning paradigms that constrain the autonomy of reasoning. To
this end, we propose RemoteReasoner, a flexible and robust workflow for remote
sensing reasoning tasks. The design of RemoteReasoner integrates a multi-modal
large language model (MLLM) for interpreting user instructions and localizing
targets, together with task adaptation strategies that enable multi-granularity
output generation. In contrast to existing methods, our framework is trained
with reinforcement learning (RL) to endow the MLLM sufficient autonomy for
precise reasoning. At the inference stage, our adaptation strategies enable
diverse output formats at inference time without requiring task-specific
decoders or further fine-tuning. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that
RemoteReasoner achieves remarkable performance across multi-granularity
reasoning tasks, including region-level and pixel-level. Additionally, our
framework enables novel capabilities such as the contour extraction task beyond
the reach of existing reasoning pipelines.

Conclusion: PINO能够生成视觉上现实、物理上协调的多角色交互，这适用于动画、游戏和机器人等多种应用。

Abstract: Generating realistic group interactions involving multiple characters remains
challenging due to increasing complexity as group size expands. While existing
conditional diffusion models incrementally generate motions by conditioning on
previously generated characters, they rely on single shared prompts, limiting
nuanced control and leading to overly simplified interactions. In this paper,
we introduce Person-Interaction Noise Optimization (PINO), a novel,
training-free framework designed for generating realistic and customizable
interactions among groups of arbitrary size. PINO decomposes complex group
interactions into semantically relevant pairwise interactions, and leverages
pretrained two-person interaction diffusion models to incrementally compose
group interactions. To ensure physical plausibility and avoid common artifacts
such as overlapping or penetration between characters, PINO employs
physics-based penalties during noise optimization. This approach allows precise
user control over character orientation, speed, and spatial relationships
without additional training. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PINO
generates visually realistic, physically coherent, and adaptable multi-person
interactions suitable for diverse animation, gaming, and robotics applications.

Conclusion: 改进后的YOLOX对象检测器在血细胞检测中比现有方法更有效，特别是在BCCD数据集上的表现显著提高，这使其在实时应用中具有高度效率。

Abstract: Detection of blood cells in microscopic images has become a major focus of
medical image analysis, playing a crucial role in gaining valuable insights
into a patient's health. Manual blood cell checks for disease detection are
known to be time-consuming, inefficient, and error-prone. To address these
limitations, analyzing blood cells using deep learning-based object detectors
can be regarded as a feasible solution. In this study, we propose automatic
blood cell detection method (ABCD) based on an improved version of YOLOX, an
object detector, for detecting various types of blood cells, including white
blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Firstly, we introduce the
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the network's backbone to
enhance the efficiency of feature extraction. Furthermore, we introduce the
Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) into the network's neck, which
optimizes the fusion of different features extracted from various stages of the
network. Finally, to speed up the model's convergence, we substitute the
Intersection over Union (IOU) loss function with the Complete Intersection over
Union (CIOU) loss function. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method is more effective than other existing methods for BCCD dataset.
Compared to the baseline algorithm, our method ABCD achieved 95.49 % mAP@0.5
and 86.89 % mAP@0.5-0.9, which are 2.8% and 23.41% higher, respectively, and
increased the detection speed by 2.9%, making it highly efficient for real-time
applications.

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows connected vehicles to exchange sensor
information and overcome each vehicle's blind spots. Yet transmitting raw point
clouds or full feature maps overwhelms Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications,
causing latency and scalability problems. We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end
framework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while
maintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage
reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions
with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural
Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and
network load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and
specialization for effective feature integration. On the OPV2V benchmark,
EffiComm reaches 0.84 mAP@0.7 while sending only an average of approximately
1.5 MB per frame, outperforming previous methods on the accuracy-per-bit curve.
These results highlight the value of adaptive, learned communication for

Abstract: Creating a virtual avatar with semantically coherent gestures that are
aligned with speech is a challenging task. Existing gesture generation research
mainly focused on generating rhythmic beat gestures, neglecting the semantic
context of the gestures. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
semantic grounding in co-speech gesture generation that integrates semantic
information at both fine-grained and global levels. Our approach starts with
learning the motion prior through a vector-quantized variational autoencoder.
Built on this model, a second-stage module is applied to automatically generate
gestures from speech, text-based semantics and speaker identity that ensures
consistency between the semantic relevance of generated gestures and
co-occurring speech semantics through semantic coherence and relevance modules.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the realism and
coherence of semantic gestures. Extensive experiments and user studies show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across two benchmarks
in co-speech gesture generation in both objective and subjective metrics. The
qualitative results of our model, code, dataset and pre-trained models can be

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a foundational model in computer
vision, excelling in generalization and adaptation to downstream tasks.
However, deploying ViTs to support diverse resource constraints typically
requires retraining multiple, size-specific ViTs, which is both time-consuming
and energy-intensive. To address this issue, we propose an efficient ViT
adaptation framework that enables a single adaptation process to generate
multiple models of varying sizes for deployment on platforms with various
resource constraints. Our approach comprises two stages. In the first stage, we
enhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture that enables
structural flexibility across MLP expansion ratio, number of attention heads,
embedding dimension, and network depth. To preserve pre-trained knowledge and
ensure stable adaptation, we adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that
progressively increases elasticity. In the second stage, we design a
lightweight router to select submodels according to computational budgets and
downstream task demands. Initialized with Pareto-optimal configurations derived
via a customized NSGA-II algorithm, the router is then jointly optimized with
the backbone. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and versatility of EA-ViT. The code is available at

but its wide adoption depends on the development of interpretable and
transparent decision-making systems. Scene captioning, which generates natural
language descriptions of the driving environment, plays a crucial role in
enhancing transparency, safety, and human-AI interaction. We introduce BEV-LLM,
a lightweight model for 3D captioning of autonomous driving scenes. BEV-LLM
leverages BEVFusion to combine 3D LiDAR point clouds and multi-view images,
incorporating a novel absolute positional encoding for view-specific scene
descriptions. Despite using a small 1B parameter base model, BEV-LLM achieves
competitive performance on the nuCaption dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art
by up to 5\% in BLEU scores. Additionally, we release two new datasets - nuView
(focused on environmental conditions and viewpoints) and GroundView (focused on
object grounding) - to better assess scene captioning across diverse driving
scenarios and address gaps in current benchmarks, along with initial
benchmarking results demonstrating their effectiveness.

### [82] [Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19409)
*Toufiq Parag,Ahmed Elgammal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MAELRE，一种高效的transformer架构，优化长上下文处理的内存和计算成本，且在多模态分类任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单设备上长上下文处理的挑战，减少二次方内存占用和推理成本。

Method: 提出一种统一高效的transformer结构（MAELRE），集成了token合并和注意力近似技术，并在不同的计算阶段逐步合并token。

Result: MAELRE在多个模态的分类任务中相比现有长上下文模型具有更高的准确性和更低的计算成本。

Conclusion: MAELRE在跨多种模态的分类任务中表现优异，提高了准确性并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: The long-context capability of recent large transformer models can be
surmised to rely on techniques such as attention/model parallelism, as well as
hardware-level optimizations. While these strategies allow input lengths to
scale to millions of tokens, they do not fundamentally mitigate the quadratic
computational and memory complexity of the core attention mechanism. In this
paper, we address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device
using generic implementations by reducing the quadratic memory footprint and
inference cost. Existing approaches to extend the context length for generic
single device implementations -- such as token merging and modified attentions
-- are often modality specific and attain a suboptimal tradeoff between
accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAELRE
(Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder), a unified and efficient
transformer architecture designed for long-range encoding across diverse
modalities. MAELRE integrates token merging with attention approximation,
progressively merging tokens at different stages of internal computational
blocks. It employs a lightweight attention approximation when the number of
tokens is large, and switches to standard dot-product attention as the sequence
becomes shorter through successive aggregation. We demonstrate that MAELRE
achieves superior accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to
existing long-context models on classification tasks spanning multiple
modalities, including text, time series, audio, and vision.

*Yiwei Lou,Yuanpeng He,Rongchao Zhang,Yongzhi Cao,Hanpin Wang,Yu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed DEFNet enhances BIQA by multitask optimization and trustworthy information fusion, showing strong results in varied scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of BIQA methods in integration and uncertainty estimation for improved performance.

Method: Multitask optimization with scene and distortion type classification, and a novel trustworthy information fusion strategy using evidential learning.

Result: Proposed framework shows effectiveness and robustness on synthetic and authentic distortion datasets.

Conclusion: Proposed framework demonstrates strong generalization and adaptability to new scenarios.

Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) methods often incorporate auxiliary
tasks to improve performance. However, existing approaches face limitations due
to insufficient integration and a lack of flexible uncertainty estimation,
leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a
multitasks-based Deep Evidential Fusion Network (DEFNet) for BIQA, which
performs multitask optimization with the assistance of scene and distortion
type classification tasks. To achieve a more robust and reliable
representation, we design a novel trustworthy information fusion strategy. It
first combines diverse features and patterns across sub-regions to enhance
information richness, and then performs local-global information fusion by
balancing fine-grained details with coarse-grained context. Moreover, DEFNet
exploits advanced uncertainty estimation technique inspired by evidential
learning with the help of normal-inverse gamma distribution mixture. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and authentic distortion datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Additional evaluation
and analysis are carried out to highlight its strong generalization capability
and adaptability to previously unseen scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种电路框架来研究LVLMs如何处理时空语义，揭示了视觉语义的对象化以及模型层次内逐渐形成的可解释概念，为模型设计提供了新方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）处理语言和图像理解的机制研究较多，但对其在时空理解方面的内部推理机制了解甚少。因此，我们设计了一个系统的电路框架，探讨这些LVLMs如何表示和处理时空视觉语义。

Method: 引入了一套电路框架，包括视觉审计电路、语义追踪电路和注意力流电路，通过这些电路观察LVLMs对时空视觉语义的处理。

Result: 发现视觉语义高度集中在特定对象标记上，移除这些标记可能导致模型性能下降多达92.6%。识别出对象和动作的可解释概念在LVLMs的中后期层中逐渐浮现和精化。揭示了中后期层对时空语义有专门的功能定位。

Conclusion: 对LVLMs的时空语义分析提供了重要的机制性洞察，为设计更稳健和可解释的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: The processing mechanisms underlying language and image understanding in
large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been extensively studied. However,
the internal reasoning mechanisms of LVLMs for spatiotemporal understanding
remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a systematic,
circuit-based framework designed to investigate how spatiotemporal visual
semantics are represented and processed within these LVLMs. Specifically, our
framework comprises three circuits: visual auditing circuit, semantic tracing
circuit, and attention flow circuit. Through the lens of these circuits, we
discover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object
tokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%.
Furthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions
emerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs.
In contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we
reveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional
localization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant
mechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a
foundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.

TL;DR: GS-Occ3D是一个仅依赖视觉的占用重建框架，克服了现有方法的限制，展示出极佳的几何重建效果和零次泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖基于LiDAR的占用注释，缺乏可扩展性，并限制了自动标注大量潜在的众包数据的能力。

Method: GS-Occ3D是一个可扩展的仅依赖视觉的框架，利用基于八叉树的高斯表面元优化显式占用表示，并将场景分解为静态背景、地面和动态物体进行有针对性的建模。

Result: GS-Occ3D在Waymo数据集上实现了最先进的几何重建结果，证明了视觉唯一二元占用标签在下游占用模型和零次泛化上的有效性及优越性。

Conclusion: GS-Occ3D展示了规模化基于视觉的占用重建的潜力，为自主驾驶感知提供了一种新范式。

Abstract: Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric
priors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly
rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and
prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for
auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only
framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy
reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic
scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing
vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from
incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To
overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation
using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and
scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,
and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is
explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly
improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled
to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on
the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry
reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from
diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy
models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.
It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy
reconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种降低3D模型训练成本的CNN初始化方法，能够在不完美的姿态监督下实现高质量的3D表示，有潜力应用于空间技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视图合成技术NeRF和3D Gaussian Splatting存在两个主要限制：需要在训练中使用姿态信息和计算代价高。解决这些问题对空间应用至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种基于卷积神经网络的3DGS初始化流程，从单眼图像中获取粗略的3D模型和目标相对于相机的姿态，并分析不同初始化变体以减少训练成本。

Result: 即使在有限或噪声姿态监督下，管线仍能学习到高保真度的3D表示，展示了该技术在空间应用中的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法显著减少了3D模型训练所需的迭代次数和输入图像数量，证明在有限姿态信息下仍能取得高质量3D表示。

Abstract: The advent of novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has enabled learning precise 3D models only from posed
monocular images. Although these methods are attractive, they hold two major
limitations that prevent their use in space applications: they require poses
during training, and have high computational cost at training and inference. To
address these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)
a pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)
and analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of
precise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D
model represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose
relative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize
3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images
needed -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the
CNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques.
This work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their
effectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose
estimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision,
the pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the
door for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications.

scenes, from driving and indoor scenes to simulated environments. We show that
DINO-world outperforms previous models on a variety of video prediction
benchmarks, e.g. segmentation and depth forecasting, and demonstrates strong
understanding of intuitive physics. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to
fine-tune the predictor on observation-action trajectories. The resulting
action-conditioned world model can be used for planning by simulating candidate
trajectories in latent space.

accuracy comparable to a state-of-the-art deep learning model while offering
higher processing speed, making it well-suited for real-time applications on

Abstract: We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair
compositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head
avatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as
an inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the
human head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and
hair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such
holistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle
swapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we
introduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of
face and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this
approach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair
from studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture
derived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and
hairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,
incorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective
separation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of
face and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.
Additionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot
manner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D
head avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical
applicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for
flexible and expressive 3D avatar generation.

*Víctor Gallego*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Specification Self-Correction (SSC)，一种新框架能够减少语言模型在有问题规范下的奖励黑客行为。实验表明该方法可显著提高模型对齐性及响应的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型容易受到上下文奖励黑客行为的影响，即在编写不当或错误的规范下，它们会利用这些漏洞取得高分，而不完成用户的真实意图。

Method: 提出了一种名为Specification Self-Correction (SSC)的新框架，该框架在测试时使语言模型能够识别并修正其指导规范中的缺陷。该方法采用了多步骤推理过程——模型首先根据可能有问题的规范生成初始响应，批评其输出，然后修订规范以去除可利用的漏洞，最后生成更可信的最终响应。

Result: 通过多个实验，SSC框架在创意写作和编码任务中将模型对规范漏洞的利用率从最初的50-70%显著降低了超过90%。此修正过程在推理时进行，不需要修改权重，并且实现了更可靠的模型行为对齐。

Conclusion: 本文提出的SSC框架能够有效减少语言模型在有问题的规范下的奖励黑客行为，提升模型的对齐性和可靠性。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are susceptible to in-context reward hacking, where
they exploit flaws in tainted or faulty written specifications or rubrics to
achieve high scores without fulfilling the user's true intent. We introduce
Specification Self-Correction (SSC), a novel, test-time framework that enables
an LM to identify and correct flaws within its own guiding specification. SSC
employs a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a
response based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output,
and then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole. A
final, more robust response is then generated using this self-corrected
specification. Across experiments spanning creative writing and agentic coding
tasks with several LMs, we demonstrate that while models initially game tainted
specifications in 50-70\% of cases, the SSC process reduces this vulnerability
by over 90\%. This dynamic repair occurs at inference time, requires no weight
modification, and leads to more robustly aligned model behavior. Code at

Motivation: 现有多语言模型在处理共享文字但在正字法和文化背景上不同的语言时表现不佳，特别是阿拉伯字母语言。

Method: 引入了AS-RoBERTa系列，每个模型都基于RoBERTa，并在以其特定语言为目标的大型语料库上进行预训练，专注于语言特定的脚本特征和统计。

Result: AS-RoBERTa变体在分类任务上比mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa的表现高出2到5个百分点。脚本专注的预训练被证明在性能提升中起到关键作用。

Conclusion: 使用阿拉伯字母的语言可以通过专注于字符脚本特征的模型得到更好的结果，特别是在分类任务中表现优于通用多语言模型。

Abstract: In natural language processing, multilingual models like mBERT and
XLM-RoBERTa promise broad coverage but often struggle with languages that share
a script yet differ in orthographic norms and cultural context. This issue is
especially notable in Arabic-script languages such as Kurdish Sorani, Arabic,
Persian, and Urdu. We introduce the Arabic Script RoBERTa (AS-RoBERTa) family:
four RoBERTa-based models, each pre-trained on a large corpus tailored to its
specific language. By focusing pre-training on language-specific script
features and statistics, our models capture patterns overlooked by
general-purpose models. When fine-tuned on classification tasks, AS-RoBERTa
variants outperform mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa by 2 to 5 percentage points. An
ablation study confirms that script-focused pre-training is central to these
gains. Error analysis using confusion matrices shows how shared script traits
and domain-specific content affect performance. Our results highlight the value
of script-aware specialization for languages using the Arabic script and
support further work on pre-training strategies rooted in script and language
specificity.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce our solution for the Multilingual Text

multilingual text detoxification pipeline that integrates lexicon-guided
tagging, a fine-tuned sequence-to-sequence model (s-nlp/mt0-xl-detox-orpo) and
an iterative classifier-based gatekeeping mechanism. Our approach departs from
prior unsupervised or monolingual pipelines by leveraging explicit toxic word
annotation via the multilingual_toxic_lexicon to guide detoxification with
greater precision and cross-lingual generalization. Our final model achieves
the highest STA (0.922) from our previous attempts, and an average official J
score of 0.612 for toxic inputs in both the development and test sets. It also
achieved xCOMET scores of 0.793 (dev) and 0.787 (test). This performance
outperforms baseline and backtranslation methods across multiple languages, and
shows strong generalization in high-resource settings (English, Russian,
French). Despite some trade-offs in SIM, the model demonstrates consistent
improvements in detoxification strength. In the competition, our team achieved
ninth place with a score of 0.612.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码混合在多语言用户中具有重要意义，但研究有限，现有生成代码混合数据的方法欠发达，限制了大语言模型在此背景下的能力评估。

Method: 提出一种生成合成代码混合文本的新方法，通过词替换结合GPT-4提示进行生成，并对LLM在18种语言和多个语言家族的代码混合数据上的表现进行评估。

Result: 分析结果显示，LLM在涉及多个语言家族的代码混合数据集上表现不佳，建议通过增加训练数据规模、模型规模和少样本学习来提高性能。

Conclusion: 现有的基准无法充分评估大语言模型的代码混合能力，本文的新方法和分析为增强多语言代码混合处理提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Code-mixing, the practice of switching between languages within a
conversation, presents unique challenges for traditional natural language
processing. Existing benchmarks, such as LinCE and GLUECoS, are limited by
narrow language pairings and tasks, failing to adequately evaluate the
code-mixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the
significance of code-mixing for multilingual users, research on LLMs in this
context remains limited. Additionally, current methods for generating
code-mixed data are underdeveloped. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of LLMs' performance on code-mixed data across 18 languages from
seven language families. We also propose a novel approach for generating
synthetic code-mixed texts by combining word substitution with GPT-4 prompting.
Our analysis reveals consistent underperformance of LLMs on code-mixed datasets
involving multiple language families. We suggest that improvements in training
data size, model scale, and few-shot learning could enhance their performance.

Method: 本文介绍了一种名为CueBuddy的方法，通过技术关键字识别和实时多语言词汇查找，为学生提供实时“词汇提示”。

Result: CueBuddy能够为学生提供必要的语言支持，使他们能够克服复杂英语术语的障碍，并保持对课程内容的关注。

Conclusion: 正在学习的课程对许多学生来说是挑战性的，尤其是当这些课程涉及到复杂的英语术语时。通过即时技术关键字识别以及多语言词汇查找，可以帮助学生克服语言障碍，更好地跟上课程的进度。

Abstract: Students across the world in STEM classes, especially in the Global South,
fall behind their peers who are more fluent in English, despite being at par
with them in terms of scientific prerequisites. While many of them are able to
follow everyday English at ease, key terms in English stay challenging. In most
cases, such students have had most of their course prerequisites in a lower
resource language. Live speech translation to lower resource languages is a
promising area of research, however, models for speech translation can be too
expensive on a large scale and often struggle with technical content. In this
paper, we describe CueBuddy, which aims to remediate these issues by providing
real-time "lexical cues" through technical keyword spotting along real-time
multilingual glossary lookup to help students stay up to speed with complex
English jargon without disrupting their concentration on the lecture. We also
describe the limitations and future extensions of our approach.

Motivation: 解决RAG在检索上下文包含混淆性信息或需要深度理解和推理时性能不足的问题。

Method: 提出了一个高效的微调框架——PrismRAG，通过训练模型处理含有干扰信息的问答对，并培养以推理为核心的习惯。

Result: PrismRAG在12个开放性RAG问答基准测试中，提升了平均事实上性5.4%，超越了最新的最先进解决方案。

Conclusion: PrismRAG框架显著提高了RAG的问答性能，特别是在包含混淆性信息和需要深度理解和推理的情境下。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often falls short when retrieved context
includes confusing semi-relevant passages, or when answering questions require
deep contextual understanding and reasoning. We propose an efficient
fine-tuning framework, called PrismRAG, that (i) trains the model with
distractor-aware QA pairs mixing gold evidence with subtle distractor passages,
and (ii) instills reasoning-centric habits that make the LLM plan, rationalize,
and synthesize without relying on extensive human engineered instructions.
Evaluated across 12 open-book RAG QA benchmarks spanning diverse application
domains and scenarios, PrismRAG improves average factuality by 5.4%,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.

TL;DR: MindFlow+是一个自我进化的对话代理，结合LLM、模仿学习和离线强化学习，表现优于基线，展示了构建专业化对话系统的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高电子商务客户服务的对话质量，同时解决传统意图识别系统在动态、多轮交互中遇到的困难。

Method: 引入MindFlow+，一种自我进化的对话代理，通过结合大语言模型、模仿学习和离线强化学习来学习域特定行为。它包括两个数据驱动机制：工具增强演示构建和奖励条件数据建模。

Result: MindFlow+在上下文相关性、灵活性和任务准确性上优于强基线。这展示了结合LLM工具推理和奖励引导学习来构建领域专业、上下文感知的对话系统的潜力。

Conclusion: MindFlow+展示了将大语言模型与工具推理和奖励引导学习相结合来创建更加专业化的对话系统的潜力。

Abstract: High-quality dialogue is crucial for e-commerce customer service, yet
traditional intent-based systems struggle with dynamic, multi-turn
interactions. We present MindFlow+, a self-evolving dialogue agent that learns
domain-specific behavior by combining large language models (LLMs) with
imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL). MindFlow+
introduces two data-centric mechanisms to guide learning: tool-augmented
demonstration construction, which exposes the model to knowledge-enhanced and
agentic (ReAct-style) interactions for effective tool use; and
reward-conditioned data modeling, which aligns responses with task-specific
goals using reward signals. To evaluate the model's role in response
generation, we introduce the AI Contribution Ratio, a novel metric quantifying
AI involvement in dialogue. Experiments on real-world e-commerce conversations
show that MindFlow+ outperforms strong baselines in contextual relevance,
flexibility, and task accuracy. These results demonstrate the potential of
combining LLMs tool reasoning, and reward-guided learning to build
domain-specialized, context-aware dialogue systems.

### [98] [NUTMEG: Separating Signal From Noise in Annotator Disagreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18890)
*Jonathan Ivey,Susan Gauch,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 引入NUTMEG模型，通过考虑标注者背景信息，解决传统数据聚合方法中标注分歧处理的问题，提高NLP模型训练表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚合方法通常将分歧视为错误，但许多任务中标注者可能存在真实分歧，这种变化应作为信号而非噪声加以对待。

Method: 引入了一种新的贝叶斯模型NUTMEG，能够利用标注者背景信息，去除人工标注训练数据中的噪声注释，同时保留系统性分歧。

Result: 在合成数据上，NUTMEG比传统聚合方法更有效地从存在系统性分歧的注释中恢复真实信息。在进一步的分析中，研究了子群体规模、分歧率和垃圾数据率如何影响模型性能。最终证明使用NUTMEG聚合的数据进行训练的下游模型明显优于使用传统聚合方法的数据进行训练的模型。

Conclusion: 本研究强调，考虑标注者的能力和系统性分歧对于使用人工标注数据进行模型训练至关重要。

Abstract: NLP models often rely on human-labeled data for training and evaluation. Many
approaches crowdsource this data from a large number of annotators with varying
skills, backgrounds, and motivations, resulting in conflicting annotations.
These conflicts have traditionally been resolved by aggregation methods that
assume disagreements are errors. Recent work has argued that for many tasks
annotators may have genuine disagreements and that variation should be treated
as signal rather than noise. However, few models separate signal and noise in
annotator disagreement. In this work, we introduce NUTMEG, a new Bayesian model
that incorporates information about annotator backgrounds to remove noisy
annotations from human-labeled training data while preserving systematic
disagreements. Using synthetic data, we show that NUTMEG is more effective at
recovering ground-truth from annotations with systematic disagreement than
traditional aggregation methods. We provide further analysis characterizing how
differences in subpopulation sizes, rates of disagreement, and rates of spam
affect the performance of our model. Finally, we demonstrate that downstream
models trained on NUTMEG-aggregated data significantly outperform models
trained on data from traditionally aggregation methods. Our results highlight
the importance of accounting for both annotator competence and systematic
disagreements when training on human-labeled data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了REPRO-Bench，评估AI代理在社会科学论文重现中的表现，发现当前的AI代理表现有限，需要更高级的代理；REPRO-Agent将代理准确率提高了71%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究论文重现基准测试集中于利用提供的代码和数据重现结果，而未能评估其与论文的一致性，简化了真实世界的情境且缺乏多样性。

Method: 引入REPRO-Bench，一套包含112个任务实例的集合，每个任务实例代表一个社会科学论文，并拥有可公开获得的重现报告。评估代表性AI代理在REPRO-Bench上的表现，并开发REPRO-Agent以提高准确性。

Result: 最佳表现的现有AI代理在REPRO-Bench上的准确率仅为21.4%，而REPRO-Agent将现有代理的最高准确性提高了71%。

Conclusion: 应开发更先进的AI代理来自动化实现现实世界的可重复性评估。

Abstract: Assessing the reproducibility of social science papers is essential for
promoting rigor in research processes, but manual assessment is costly. With
recent advances in agentic AI systems (i.e., AI agents), we seek to evaluate
their capability to automate this process. However, existing benchmarks for
reproducing research papers (1) focus solely on reproducing results using
provided code and data without assessing their consistency with the paper, (2)
oversimplify real-world scenarios, and (3) lack necessary diversity in data
formats and programming languages. To address these issues, we introduce
REPRO-Bench, a collection of 112 task instances, each representing a social
science paper with a publicly available reproduction report. The agents are
tasked with assessing the reproducibility of the paper based on the original
paper PDF and the corresponding reproduction package. REPRO-Bench features
end-to-end evaluation tasks on the reproducibility of social science papers
with complexity comparable to real-world assessments. We evaluate three
representative AI agents on REPRO-Bench, with the best-performing agent
achieving an accuracy of only 21.4%. Building on our empirical analysis, we
develop REPRO-Agent, which improves the highest accuracy achieved by existing
agents by 71%. We conclude that more advanced AI agents should be developed to
automate real-world reproducibility assessment. REPRO-Bench is publicly
available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/REPRO-Bench.

*Hongyuan Lu,Zixuan Li,Zefan Zhang,Wai Lam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ADS的新任务和SLoW方法，以选择性使用低频词词典来提升LLM翻译性能，节省Token使用并优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型仅支持数百种语言，而全球存在超过7,000种语言，现有方法使用所有可用字典可能过于昂贵，因此需要在Token消耗和翻译性能之间取得平衡。

Method: 提出了一种新的方法SLoW（选择低频词），选择那些词频较低的词典，以增强LLM的翻译效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，SLoW方法在FLORES的100种语言上超越了强基准，并且能够显著节省Token使用。

Conclusion: SLoW方法超越了强基准，可以明显节省Token使用，甚至在很多语言中超过了完整字典基准的翻译性能。

Abstract: There are more than 7,000 languages around the world, and current Large
Language Models (LLMs) only support hundreds of languages. Dictionary-based
prompting methods can enhance translation on them, but most methods use all the
available dictionaries, which could be expensive. Instead, it will be flexible
to have a trade-off between token consumption and translation performance. This
paper proposes a novel task called \textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{D}ictionary
\textbf{S}election (\textbf{ADS}). The goal of the task is to automatically
select which dictionary to use to enhance translation. We propose a novel and
effective method which we call \textbf{S}elect \textbf{Lo}w-frequency
\textbf{W}ords! (\textbf{SLoW}) which selects those dictionaries that have a
lower frequency. Our methods have unique advantages. First, there is no need
for access to the training data for frequency estimation (which is usually
unavailable). Second, it inherits the advantage of dictionary-based methods,
where no additional tuning is required on LLMs. Experimental results on 100
languages from FLORES indicate that SLoW surpasses strong baselines, and it can
obviously save token usage, with many languages even surpassing the translation
performance of the full dictionary baseline.\footnote{A shocking fact is that
there is no need to use the actual training data (often unobtainable) for
frequency estimation, and an estimation frequency obtained using public
resources is still apparently effective in improving translation with ChatGPT
and Llama, and DeepSeek.}\footnote{Code and data available upon publication.}

TL;DR: 研究评估了四种公开可用的大语言模型聊天机器人的安全性，发现存在显著差异，并指出需要进一步改善其临床安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 考虑到大量患者使用大型语言模型聊天机器人获取医疗建议，研究旨在评估这些机器人是否安全。

Method: 使用新的数据集HealthAdvice和评估框架对四个聊天机器人进行定量和定性分析。

Result: 发现聊天机器人之间存在显著的安全性差异，问题性反应率为21.6%到43.2%，不安全反应率为5%到13%。

Conclusion: 许多患者可能收到不安全的医疗建议，需要进一步研究以提高聊天机器人的临床安全性。

Abstract: Millions of patients are already using large language model (LLM) chatbots
for medical advice on a regular basis, raising patient safety concerns. This
physician-led red-teaming study compares the safety of four publicly available
chatbots--Claude by Anthropic, Gemini by Google, GPT-4o by OpenAI, and
Llama3-70B by Meta--on a new dataset, HealthAdvice, using an evaluation
framework that enables quantitative and qualitative analysis. In total, 888
chatbot responses are evaluated for 222 patient-posed advice-seeking medical
questions on primary care topics spanning internal medicine, women's health,
and pediatrics. We find statistically significant differences between chatbots.
The rate of problematic responses varies from 21.6 percent (Claude) to 43.2
percent (Llama), with unsafe responses varying from 5 percent (Claude) to 13
percent (GPT-4o, Llama). Qualitative results reveal chatbot responses with the
potential to lead to serious patient harm. This study suggests that millions of
patients could be receiving unsafe medical advice from publicly available
chatbots, and further work is needed to improve the clinical safety of these
powerful tools.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a major advancement in
natural language processing (NLP), combining large language models (LLMs) with
information retrieval systems to enhance factual grounding, accuracy, and
contextual relevance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of
RAG, tracing its evolution from early developments in open domain question
answering to recent state-of-the-art implementations across diverse
applications. The review begins by outlining the motivations behind RAG,
particularly its ability to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge in
parametric models. Core technical components-retrieval mechanisms,
sequence-to-sequence generation models, and fusion strategies are examined in
detail. A year-by-year analysis highlights key milestones and research trends,
providing insight into RAG's rapid growth. The paper further explores the
deployment of RAG in enterprise systems, addressing practical challenges
related to retrieval of proprietary data, security, and scalability. A
comparative evaluation of RAG implementations is conducted, benchmarking
performance on retrieval accuracy, generation fluency, latency, and
computational efficiency. Persistent challenges such as retrieval quality,
privacy concerns, and integration overhead are critically assessed. Finally,
the review highlights emerging solutions, including hybrid retrieval
approaches, privacy-preserving techniques, optimized fusion strategies, and
agentic RAG architectures. These innovations point toward a future of more
reliable, efficient, and context-aware knowledge-intensive NLP systems.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种方法，通过挖掘图像中视觉元素的关联生成创意标题，改进了视觉编码器在诗歌和隐喻可视化检索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型依赖于网页抓取数据集的问题，开发一种能够对任何未标记数据集进行关联挖掘的方法。

Method: 使用一种方法挖掘图像中视觉元素的关联，这些关联用于生成高质量的创意标题，并对视觉编码器进行微调。

Result: 生成了1.7百万个高质量创意标题的数据集，人类评估显示这些标题在视觉上仍然有基础且具备抽象性；在创意领域检索能力上获得显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过引入一种方法来挖掘图像中显著视觉元素的关联，可以生成高质量的创意标题，并提升视觉编码器在诗歌和隐喻可视化等创意领域的零样本图像-文本检索能力。

Abstract: Understanding another person's creative output requires a shared language of
association. However, when training vision-language models such as CLIP, we
rely on web-scraped datasets containing short, predominantly literal, alt-text.
In this work, we introduce a method for mining contextualized associations for
salient visual elements in an image that can scale to any unlabeled dataset.
Given an image, we can use these mined associations to generate high quality
creative captions at increasing degrees of abstraction. With our method, we
produce a new dataset of visual associations and 1.7m creative captions for the
images in MSCOCO. Human evaluation confirms that these captions remain visually
grounded while exhibiting recognizably increasing abstraction. Moreover,
fine-tuning a visual encoder on this dataset yields meaningful improvements in
zero-shot image-text retrieval in two creative domains: poetry and metaphor
visualization. We release our dataset, our generation code and our models for
use by the broader community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多语言大模型中，中低资源语言的激活水平偏低，通过LoRA微调能改善激活差异，并提升基准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别和解决多语言大模型中不同语言间的激活不均衡问题，特别是中低资源语言在基准测试中的表现不足。

Method: 使用稀疏自动编码器分析了Gemma-2-2B模型中不同语言的激活模式，并应用了Low-Rank Adaptation（LoRA）进行激活感知微调。

Result: 经过激活感知微调后，语言如马拉雅拉姆语和印地语的激活情况大幅提升，分别达到87.69%和86.32%；在基准测试中表现也有小幅但持续的提升。

Conclusion: 利用激活感知微调方法（如LoRA）能够显著改善低资源语言的激活情况，并在多语言大模型中提升这些语言在基准测试中的表现。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong cross-linguistic
generalization, yet medium to low resource languages underperform on common
benchmarks such as ARC-Challenge, MMLU, and HellaSwag. We analyze activation
patterns in Gemma-2-2B across all 26 residual layers and 10 languages: Chinese
(zh), Russian (ru), Spanish (es), Italian (it), medium to low resource
languages including Indonesian (id), Catalan (ca), Marathi (mr), Malayalam
(ml), and Hindi (hi), with English (en) as the reference. Using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs), we reveal systematic disparities in activation patterns.
Medium to low resource languages receive up to 26.27 percent lower activations
in early layers, with a persistent gap of 19.89 percent in deeper layers. To
address this, we apply activation-aware fine-tuning via Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), leading to substantial activation gains, such as 87.69 percent for
Malayalam and 86.32 percent for Hindi, while maintaining English retention at
approximately 91 percent. After fine-tuning, benchmark results show modest but
consistent improvements, highlighting activation alignment as a key factor in
enhancing multilingual LLM performance.

TL;DR: 提出LLaVA-NeuMT框架，通过层选择和神经元适应策略，在只微调40%参数下实现多语言、多模态翻译的最新成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态机器翻译方法在双语环境中表现良好，但在多语言翻译扩展时由于跨语言干扰和参数共享策略无效面临挑战。为了解决这一问题，提出了LLaVA-NeuMT框架。

Method: 提出了一种层选择机制，用于识别不同语言对最具信息的层，以及一种神经元级的适应策略，以动态选择语言特定和语言无关的神经元，从而提高翻译质量并减少冗余。

Result: 通过大量实验表明，在M3-Multi30K和M3-AmbigCaps数据集上，新框架超越了完整微调方法并实现了SOTA（state-of-the-art）结果。

Conclusion: LLaVA-NeuMT，在只微调40%的模型参数的情况下，超越了全参数微调的方法，在M3-Multi30K和M3-AmbigCaps数据集上实现了最新的结果。

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) enhances translation quality by
incorporating visual context, helping to resolve textual ambiguities. While
existing MMT methods perform well in bilingual settings, extending them to
multilingual translation remains challenging due to cross-lingual interference
and ineffective parameter-sharing strategies. To address this, we propose
LLaVA-NeuMT, a novel multimodal multilingual translation framework that
explicitly models language-specific and language-agnostic representations to
mitigate multilingual interference. Our approach consists of a layer selection
mechanism that identifies the most informative layers for different language
pairs and a neuron-level adaptation strategy that dynamically selects
language-specific and agnostic neurons to improve translation quality while
reducing redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on the M3-Multi30K and
M3-AmbigCaps datasets, demonstrating that LLaVA-NeuMT, while fine-tuning only
40\% of the model parameters, surpasses full fine-tuning approaches and
ultimately achieves SOTA results on both datasets. Our analysis further
provides insights into the importance of selected layers and neurons in
multimodal multilingual adaptation, offering an efficient and scalable solution
to cross-lingual adaptation in multimodal translation.

Abstract: Legal document summarization represents a significant advancement towards
improving judicial efficiency through the automation of key information
detection. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques to meticulously identify and extract essential data from extensive
legal texts, which facilitates a more efficient review process. By employing
advanced machine learning algorithms, the framework recognizes underlying

professionals, concurrently reducing the likelihood of overlooking vital
information that could lead to errors. Through comprehensive experiments
conducted with actual legal datasets, we demonstrate the capability of our
method to generate high-quality summaries while preserving the integrity of the
original content and enhancing processing times considerably. The results
reveal marked improvements in operational efficiency, allowing legal
practitioners to direct their efforts toward critical analytical and
decision-making activities instead of manual reviews. This research highlights
promising technology-driven strategies that can significantly alter workflow
dynamics within the legal sector, emphasizing the role of automation in
refining judicial processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏一种可靠的自动方法来比较对话的整体互动动态，这种方法可以增强对话数据的分析并更全面地评估对话代理。

Method: 引入了一种用于比较对话动态的相似性度量方法，并设计了一个验证框架来测试该度量的稳健性和敏感性。

Result: 使用该相似性度量方法分析了一个大型在线社区中的对话动态，带来了关于情境权力在对话中作用的新见解。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的相似性度量方法，用于比较对话的动态特征，并验证了其在捕捉对话动态差异方面的稳健性以及对话题敏感性的评估。

Abstract: The quality of a conversation goes beyond the individual quality of each
reply, and instead emerges from how these combine into interactional patterns
that give the conversation its distinctive overall "shape". However, there is
no robust automated method for comparing conversations in terms of their
overall interactional dynamics. Such methods could enhance the analysis of
conversational data and help evaluate conversational agents more holistically.
  In this work, we introduce a similarity measure for comparing conversations
with respect to their dynamics. We design a validation framework for testing
the robustness of the metric in capturing differences in conversation dynamics
and for assessing its sensitivity to the topic of the conversations. Finally,
to illustrate the measure's utility, we use it to analyze conversational
dynamics in a large online community, bringing new insights into the role of
situational power in conversations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Multi-TAG框架，用于增强复杂数学问题解决能力，可显著提升LLM在多项基准上的表现，无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具增强的LLM在复杂数学问题上表现有限，因此需要一种新方法来提高推理步骤多的数学问题的解决能力。

Method: 提出了一个多工具聚合框架Multi-TAG，让LLM同时调用多个工具，通过聚合这些工具的输出来验证并优化推理过程。

Result: Multi-TAG在MATH500、AIME、AMC和OlympiadBench上实现了平均6.0%到7.5%的性能提升。

Conclusion: Multi-TAG在多种基准上优于现有方法，实现了显著的性能提升，尤其是在复杂数学推理问题中表现突出。

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising
avenue for developing high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. Prior
tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a
single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math
reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with
more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps.
To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool
AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG
guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It
then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning
process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a
finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any
LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally
expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned
with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks:
MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and
closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0%
to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 现有的争论摘要生成方法主要依赖于单次生成，缺乏对事实纠正或结构优化的支持。

Method: 引入Arg-LLaDA, 一种新的大型语言扩散框架，通过充分性引导的重遮罩和再生策略迭代改进摘要。

Result: 在两组基准数据集上的实验结果表明，Arg-LLaDA在10个自动评估指标中有7个超过了最先进的基线。此外，人类评估显示在覆盖率、真实度和简洁性方面有显著改善。

Conclusion: Arg-LLaDA在实验数据集上优于现有的最先进技术，并在人类评估中表现出显著改进。

Abstract: Argument summarization aims to generate concise, structured representations
of complex, multi-perspective debates. While recent work has advanced the
identification and clustering of argumentative components, the generation stage
remains underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass
generation, offering limited support for factual correction or structural
refinement. To address this gap, we introduce Arg-LLaDA, a novel large language
diffusion framework that iteratively improves summaries via sufficiency-guided
remasking and regeneration. Our method combines a flexible masking controller
with a sufficiency-checking module to identify and revise unsupported,
redundant, or incomplete spans, yielding more faithful, concise, and coherent
outputs. Empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that Arg-LLaDA
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 automatic evaluation
metrics. In addition, human evaluations reveal substantial improvements across
core dimensions, coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, validating the
effectiveness of our iterative, sufficiency-aware generation strategy.

Abstract: Claim verification is critical for enhancing digital literacy. However, the
state-of-the-art single-LLM methods struggle with complex claim verification
that involves multi-faceted evidences. Inspired by real-world fact-checking
practices, we propose DebateCV, the first claim verification framework that
adopts a debate-driven methodology using multiple LLM agents. In our framework,
two Debaters take opposing stances on a claim and engage in multi-round
argumentation, while a Moderator evaluates the arguments and renders a verdict
with justifications. To further improve the performance of the Moderator, we
introduce a novel post-training strategy that leverages synthetic debate data
generated by the zero-shot DebateCV, effectively addressing the scarcity of
real-world debate-driven claim verification data. Experimental results show
that our method outperforms existing claim verification methods under varying
levels of evidence quality. Our code and dataset are publicly available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DebateCV-6781.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于用户研究的主题解释理论，认为用户通常使用锚定和调整启发法来解释主题，这需要认知偏置感知的用户模型和评价框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的主题质量评价方法如连贯性和词插入并没有衡量主题在探索语料库中的作用，为此需要基于任务和用户群体的评价标准。

Method: 研究中采用了用户研究以了解用户如何解释主题，并使用反身性主题分析来识别主题解释的主题。

Result: 提出了一种基于锚定和调整启发法的主题解释理论。

Conclusion: 主题的解释受到启发性和代表性启发法的影响，而不是基于概率。

Abstract: Interpretation of topics is crucial for their downstream applications.
State-of-the-art evaluation measures of topic quality such as coherence and
word intrusion do not measure how much a topic facilitates the exploration of a
corpus. To design evaluation measures grounded on a task, and a population of
users, we do user studies to understand how users interpret topics. We propose
constructs of topic quality and ask users to assess them in the context of a
topic and provide rationale behind evaluations. We use reflexive thematic
analysis to identify themes of topic interpretations from rationales. Users
interpret topics based on availability and representativeness heuristics rather
than probability. We propose a theory of topic interpretation based on the
anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic: users anchor on salient words and make
semantic adjustments to arrive at an interpretation. Topic interpretation can
be viewed as making a judgment under uncertainty by an ecologically rational
user, and hence cognitive biases aware user models and evaluation frameworks
are needed.

TL;DR: LLMs在生成文本时可能会加入性别和职业偏见，涉及的偏见可能会影响多领域的伦理问题，因此需要深入研究和缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在无性别提示中对性别和职业偏见的影响，探讨这些模型如何可能助长偏见输出。

Method: 采用结构化的实验方法，给出涉及三个不同职业组合的不同提示，这些职业之间具有层级关系。在意大利语中进行了研究，因为该语言具有广泛的语法性别差异，并通过API收集了两个流行的LLM聊天机器人的3600个响应。

Result: 研究显示，LLMs生成的内容可能会加强刻板印象。例如，Gemini将100%的“她”的代词与“助理”而不是“经理”相关联，而ChatGPT则为97%。

Conclusion: LLMs在处理无性别提示时可能会生成带有偏见的内容，这种偏见可能对工作场所等多个领域带来伦理问题。理解这些风险对于制定缓解策略并确保AI系统的公平性至关重要。

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a large variety of
domains has sparked worries about how easily they can perpetuate stereotypes
and contribute to the generation of biased content. With a focus on gender and
professional bias, this work examines in which manner LLMs shape responses to
ungendered prompts, contributing to biased outputs. This analysis uses a
structured experimental method, giving different prompts involving three
different professional job combinations, which are also characterized by a
hierarchical relationship. This study uses Italian, a language with extensive
grammatical gender differences, to highlight potential limitations in current
LLMs' ability to generate objective text in non-English languages. Two popular
LLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google
Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600
responses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate
stereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she'
pronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in
AI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in
the workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use.
Understanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and
assuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather
contribute to more equitable outcomes. Future research directions include
expanding the study to additional chatbots or languages, refining prompt
engineering methods or further exploiting a larger experimental base.

TL;DR: 本文研究指出，数据中毒显著增加 AAVE 输入的输出毒性，并强调了需要方言意识评估和去偏 interventions。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）的设计不断改进以促进包容和均衡响应，然而这些系统仍然容易编码和放大社会偏见。

Method: 本研究使用了小型和中型的 LLaMA 模型进行实验，并使用 GPT-4o 作为公平审计工具。

Result: 实验显示，即使是最少量的带毒数据暴露也能显著增加 AAVE 输入的毒性，而 SAE 则几乎不受影响。

Conclusion: 本文强调了数据中毒和方言偏见的复合影响，并呼吁在开发过程中进行方言意识评估、有针对性的去偏 intervention 和社会责任培训。

Abstract: Despite the ongoing improvements in the design of large language models
(LLMs) to foster inclusion and balanced responses, these systems remain
susceptible to encoding and amplifying social biases. This study examines how
dialectal variation, specifically African American Vernacular English (AAVE)
versus Standard American English (SAE), interacts with data poisoning to
influence toxicity in outputs. Using both small- and medium-scale LLaMA models,
we show that even minimal exposure to poisoned data significantly increases
toxicity for AAVE inputs, while it remains comparatively unaffected for SAE.
Larger models exhibit a more significant amplification effect which suggests
heightened susceptibility with scale. To further assess these disparities, we
employed GPT-4o as a fairness auditor, which identified harmful stereotypical
patterns disproportionately tied to AAVE inputs, including portrayals of
aggression, criminality, and intellectual inferiority. These findings
underscore the compounding impact of data poisoning and dialectal bias and
emphasize the need for dialect-aware evaluation, targeted debiasing
interventions, and socially responsible training protocols during development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的动态框架ArxivRoll，通过自动生成测试案例和测量污染训练偏差解决大型语言模型评估中的高估问题，提高评估透明性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在评估中的高估问题日益严重，公开基准可能由于污染或失衡训练导致不真实的评估结果，影响模型间的公平比较和真实能力评估。现有方法无法同时保证可重现性、透明性和高效率，而目前模型的高估程度尚未量化。

Method: 提出ArxivRoll，一种动态评估框架。包括SCP（Sequencing, Cloze, and Prediction），自动生成私有测试案例，以及Rugged Scores，衡量基准污染和训练偏差。每六个月构建新基准，并进行一次性评估。

Result: 实验表明新基准质量较高，对当前大型语言模型进行了系统评估。

Conclusion: ArxivRoll通过动态框架解决了高估问题，确保了评估的透明性和效率，并量化了模型评估的高估程度。

Abstract: Overestimation in evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become an
increasing concern. Due to the contamination of public benchmarks or imbalanced
model training, LLMs may achieve unreal evaluation results on public
benchmarks, either intentionally or unintentionally, which leads to unfair
comparisons among LLMs and undermines their realistic capability assessments.
Existing benchmarks attempt to address these issues by keeping test cases
permanently secret, mitigating contamination through human evaluation, or
repeatedly collecting and constructing new samples. However, these approaches
fail to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and high efficiency
simultaneously. Moreover, the extent of overestimation in current LLMs remains
unquantified. To address these issues, we propose ArxivRoll, a dynamic
evaluation framework inspired by one-time pad encryption in cryptography.
ArxivRoll comprises two key components: \emph{i) SCP (Sequencing, Cloze, and
Prediction)}, an automated generator for private test cases, and \emph{ii)
Rugged Scores (RS)}, metrics that measure the proportion of public benchmark
contamination and training bias. Leveraging SCP, ArxivRoll constructs a new
benchmark every six months using recent articles from ArXiv and employs them
for one-time evaluations of LLM performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the high quality of our benchmark, and we provide a systematic evaluation of
current LLMs. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reveals vulnerabilities of LLDMs to jailbreak attacks, introduces a successful attack method, and raises safety concerns in LLDMs deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reveal and address the safety vulnerabilities in Large Language Diffusion Models that are not effectively managed by existing jailbreak methodologies for LLMs.

Method: Introduced a Parallel Decoding jailbreak (PAD) method using Multi-Point Attention Attack for diffusion-based language models.

Result: PAD achieves a 97% success rate in jailbreak attacks on LLDMs and reveals that LLDMs generate harmful content 2x faster than autoregressive LLMs of the same size.

Conclusion: LLDMs exhibit vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks despite their advantages over LLMs, raising concerns over their safety in deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Diffusion Models (LLDMs) exhibit comparable performance to
LLMs while offering distinct advantages in inference speed and mathematical
reasoning tasks.The precise and rapid generation capabilities of LLDMs amplify
concerns of harmful generations, while existing jailbreak methodologies
designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) prove limited effectiveness against
LLDMs and fail to expose safety vulnerabilities.Successful defense cannot
definitively resolve harmful generation concerns, as it remains unclear whether
LLDMs possess safety robustness or existing attacks are incompatible with
diffusion-based architectures.To address this, we first reveal the
vulnerability of LLDMs to jailbreak and demonstrate that attack failure in
LLDMs stems from fundamental architectural differences.We present a PArallel
Decoding jailbreak (PAD) for diffusion-based language models. PAD introduces
Multi-Point Attention Attack, which guides parallel generative processes toward
harmful outputs that inspired by affirmative response patterns in LLMs.
Experimental evaluations across four LLDMs demonstrate that PAD achieves
jailbreak attack success rates by 97%, revealing significant safety
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, compared to autoregressive LLMs of the same size,
LLDMs increase the harmful generation speed by 2x, significantly highlighting
risks of uncontrolled misuse.Through comprehensive analysis, we provide an
investigation into LLDM architecture, offering critical insights for the secure
deployment of diffusion-based language models.

TL;DR: 论文评估大型语言模型在识别民粹主义话语上的表现，发现微调的RoBERTa分类器性能优越，而指令调整的LLM在跨域数据上表现稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探讨大型语言模型能否识别并分类复杂的民粹主义形式，这是学术和媒体辩论中一个复杂争议的概念。

Method: 作者使用了一系列预训练的大型语言模型，并通过不同的提示范式评估其表现。此外，创建了专门设计用以捕捉民粹主义话语的新型数据集，并使用微调的RoBERTa分类器进行实验。最后，评估了模型在欧洲政治家竞选演讲上的泛化能力。

Result: 结果显示，微调的RoBERTa分类器在检测民粹主义话语方面，性能显著优于未经微调的新型大型语言模型，而指令调整的LLM在跨域数据测试中表现出更好的稳健性。

Conclusion: 论文结论指出，大型语言模型在识别和分类复杂的民粹主义话语方面显示出显著的性能差异。经过微调的RoBERTa分类器在检测民粹主义话语方面表现优于所有新型指令调整的LLM，除非后者经过微调。在跨域数据环境中，指令调整的LLM表现出更高的稳健性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of instruction-following tasks, yet their grasp of nuanced social
science concepts remains underexplored. This paper examines whether LLMs can
identify and classify fine-grained forms of populism, a complex and contested
concept in both academic and media debates. To this end, we curate and release
novel datasets specifically designed to capture populist discourse. We evaluate
a range of pre-trained (large) language models, both open-weight and
proprietary, across multiple prompting paradigms. Our analysis reveals notable
variation in performance, highlighting the limitations of LLMs in detecting
populist discourse. We find that a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier vastly
outperforms all new-era instruction-tuned LLMs, unless fine-tuned.
Additionally, we apply our best-performing model to analyze campaign speeches
by Donald Trump, extracting valuable insights into his strategic use of
populist rhetoric. Finally, we assess the generalizability of these models by
benchmarking them on campaign speeches by European politicians, offering a lens
into cross-context transferability in political discourse analysis. In this
setting, we find that instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit greater robustness on
out-of-domain data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法常常需要本体特定的训练，难以在不同文本类型和不断变化的生物医学术语中进行泛化。

Method: AutoPCR是一种不需要本体特定训练的基于提示的表型概念识别方法。它在三个阶段进行：使用规则基础和神经标记策略混合的实体提取，通过SapBERT进行候选检索，以及通过提示大型语言模型进行实体链接。

Result: AutoPCR在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，其在提及级别和文档级别评估中实现了最佳平均和最稳健的性能，超过了以前的最新技术。

Conclusion: AutoPCR展示了其归纳能力和在新的本体上的泛化能力。

Abstract: Phenotype concept recognition (CR) is a fundamental task in biomedical text
mining, enabling applications such as clinical diagnostics and knowledge graph
construction. However, existing methods often require ontology-specific
training and struggle to generalize across diverse text types and evolving
biomedical terminology. We present AutoPCR, a prompt-based phenotype CR method
that does not require ontology-specific training. AutoPCR performs CR in three
stages: entity extraction using a hybrid of rule-based and neural tagging
strategies, candidate retrieval via SapBERT, and entity linking through
prompting a large language model. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show
that AutoPCR achieves the best average and most robust performance across both
mention-level and document-level evaluations, surpassing prior state-of-the-art
methods. Further ablation and transfer studies demonstrate its inductive
capability and generalizability to new ontologies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Smooth Reading的方法，改善了循环LLM在长上下文任务中的性能，使其达到与自注意LLM相当的水平，同时提高了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环LLM由于其有限的固定大小内存，在长上下文任务上表现不佳，文章认为这是因为一次处理整个上下文不适合循环LLM，因此提出了Smooth Reading方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为Smooth Reading的逐块推理方法，通过分块处理上下文并迭代总结上下文信息，减少记忆需求，使其更适合循环LLM。

Result: 使用Smooth Reading的SWA-3B-4k（循环LLM）在LongBench上的表现从比自注意LLM低5.68%提升到高出3.61%。此外，该方法在64k上下文时训练速度快3倍，推理速度快2倍。

Conclusion: Smooth Reading方法有效缩小了循环LLM与自注意LLM在长上下文任务中的性能差距，同时保留了循环LLM的效率优势。

Abstract: Recently, recurrent large language models (Recurrent LLMs) with linear
computational complexity have re-emerged as efficient alternatives to
self-attention-based LLMs (Self-Attention LLMs), which have quadratic
complexity. However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks
due to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused
on enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural
innovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match
the performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that
this limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not
well-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a
chunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth
Reading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual
information, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more
compatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method
substantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention
LLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of
Recurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from
5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.
Besides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and
inferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using
Recurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We hope
our method will inspire future research in this area. To facilitate further
progress, we will release code and dataset.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了通过时间戳对齐来提高自动语音识别和说话人分离对话情感识别准确性的方法，结果显示对齐提升了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR转录本与说话人分离输出之间的未对齐经常会降低多模态情感识别系统的可靠性，特别是在对话情境中。

Method: 使用预训练的ASR和说话人分离模型进行对齐管道，系统地同步时间戳生成精确标记的说话人段落。多模态方法结合通过RoBERTa提取的文本嵌入和来自Wav2Vec的音频嵌入，利用通过门机制增强的交叉注意力融合。

Result: 实验评估表明，精确的时间戳对齐提高了情感识别的准确性，优于缺乏同步的基线方法。

Conclusion: 精确的时间戳对齐能够提高情感识别的准确性，对于增强整体的情感识别准确性具有重要作用，为可靠的多模态情感分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of incorporating timestamp-based
alignment between Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts and Speaker
Diarization (SD) outputs on Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) accuracy.
Misalignment between these two modalities often reduces the reliability of
multimodal emotion recognition systems, particularly in conversational
contexts. To address this issue, we introduce an alignment pipeline utilizing
pre-trained ASR and speaker diarization models, systematically synchronizing
timestamps to generate accurately labeled speaker segments. Our multimodal
approach combines textual embeddings extracted via RoBERTa with audio
embeddings from Wav2Vec, leveraging cross-attention fusion enhanced by a gating
mechanism. Experimental evaluations on the IEMOCAP benchmark dataset
demonstrate that precise timestamp alignment improves SER accuracy,
outperforming baseline methods that lack synchronization. The results highlight
the critical importance of temporal alignment, demonstrating its effectiveness
in enhancing overall emotion recognition accuracy and providing a foundation
for robust multimodal emotion analysis.

Motivation: 为了超越传统的语音理解评估指标，如词错误率（WER），提出了一种更全面的评估方法。

Method: 利用Bloom's分类法的三个认知层次：记忆、理解、应用，对语言模型的语音理解进行评估。

Result: SIQ不仅量化了语音理解的能力，还能在级联方法（例如ASR LLM）和端到端模型之间提供统一比较，识别现有基准中的标注错误，并检测语言模型的幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 引入了一种新的评估管道，称为基于语音的智商（SIQ），用于评估大语言模型在语音理解方面的能力。

Abstract: We introduce Speech-based Intelligence Quotient (SIQ) as a new form of human
cognition-inspired evaluation pipeline for voice understanding large language
models, LLM Voice, designed to assess their voice understanding ability. Moving
beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ
examines LLM Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy:
(1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e.,
similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy
for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies
voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between
cascaded methods (e.g., ASR LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation
errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM Voice. Our
framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges
cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while exposing overlooked
challenges in multi-modal training.

Result: 实验结果显示，增强后的数据集在保留原始文本和音频特征的基础上，引入了新的错误类型，可以用来提升二语学习者的GEC评分。

Conclusion: 通过实验验证表明，使用经过增强的数据集可提高书面GEC和语音GEC任务的性能。

Abstract: While there exist strong benchmark datasets for grammatical error correction
(GEC), high-quality annotated spoken datasets for Spoken GEC (SGEC) are still
under-resourced. In this paper, we propose a fully automated method to generate
audio-text pairs with grammatical errors and disfluencies. Moreover, we propose
a series of objective metrics that can be used to evaluate the generated data
and choose the more suitable dataset for SGEC. The goal is to generate an
augmented dataset that maintains the textual and acoustic characteristics of
the original data while providing new types of errors. This augmented dataset
should augment and enrich the original corpus without altering the language
assessment scores of the second language (L2) learners. We evaluate the use of
the augmented corpus both for written GEC (the text part) and for SGEC (the
audio-text pairs). Our experiments are conducted on the S\&I Corpus, the first
publicly available speech dataset with grammar error annotations.

Motivation: 设置一个基准，检测荷兰临床自由文本文件中的不良药物事件（ADE），使用多种变压器模型、临床场景和适合用途的性能衡量标准。

Method: 使用Bi-LSTM模型和四个基于变压器的荷兰语及多语言编码器模型（BERTje、RobBERT、MedRoBERTa.nl和NuNER），在荷兰ICU临床进展报告中进行命名实体识别（NER）和关系分类（RC）任务。对ADE RC模型进行内部评估，并在文档级别进行外部验证。报告了微平均和宏平均F1分数。

Result: MedRoBERTa.nl模型在ADE RC任务和外部验证中表现最佳。

Conclusion: MedRoBERTa.nl模型在ADE检测任务中表现最佳，宏平均F1分数为0.63（使用标准实体）和0.62（使用预测实体）。在外部验证中，MedRoBERTa.nl模型的召回率为0.67到0.74，表明在67%到74%的出院信中检测到了ADE。

Abstract: In this study, we set a benchmark for adverse drug event (ADE) detection in
Dutch clinical free text documents using several transformer models, clinical
scenarios and fit-for-purpose performance measures. We trained a Bidirectional
Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model and four transformer-based Dutch and/or
multilingual encoder models (BERTje, RobBERT, MedRoBERTa.nl, and NuNER) for the
tasks of named entity recognition (NER) and relation classification (RC) using
102 richly annotated Dutch ICU clinical progress notes. Anonymized free text
clinical progress notes of patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of
one academic hospital and discharge letters of patients admitted to Internal
Medicine wards of two non-academic hospitals were reused. We evaluated our ADE
RC models internally using gold standard (two-step task) and predicted entities
(end-to-end task). In addition, all models were externally validated on
detecting ADEs at the document level. We report both micro- and macro-averaged
F1 scores, given the imbalance of ADEs in the datasets. Although differences
for the ADE RC task between the models were small, MedRoBERTa.nl was the best
performing model with macro-averaged F1 score of 0.63 using gold standard and
0.62 using predicted entities. The MedRoBERTa.nl models also performed the best
in our external validation and achieved recall of between 0.67 to 0.74 using
predicted entities, meaning between 67 to 74% of discharge letters with ADEs
were detected. Our benchmark study presents a robust and clinically meaningful
approach for evaluating language models for ADE detection in clinical free text
documents. Our study highlights the need to use appropriate performance
measures fit for the task of ADE detection in clinical free-text documents and
envisioned future clinical use.

Motivation: 现有医疗文本嵌入模型局限于狭窄的数据训练且技术上不够先进，并且缺乏适当的评估方法。

Method: 引入了MEDTE模型，通过自监督对比学习技术从多种医疗语料库进行微调。

Result: MEDTE模型在51个任务的基准套件中表现优异，超越现有先进技术。

Conclusion: 本文提出的MEDTE模型通过对多种医疗文本进行自监督对比学习增强了嵌入的鲁棒性，并在多任务上表现优于现有技术。

Abstract: Medical text embedding models are foundational to a wide array of healthcare
applications, ranging from clinical decision support and biomedical information
retrieval to medical question answering, yet they remain hampered by two
critical shortcomings. First, most models are trained on a narrow slice of
medical and biological data, beside not being up to date in terms of
methodology, making them ill suited to capture the diversity of terminology and
semantics encountered in practice. Second, existing evaluations are often
inadequate: even widely used benchmarks fail to generalize across the full
spectrum of real world medical tasks.
  To address these gaps, we leverage MEDTE, a GTE model extensively fine-tuned
on diverse medical corpora through self-supervised contrastive learning across
multiple data sources, to deliver robust medical text embeddings.
  Alongside this model, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite of 51 tasks
spanning classification, clustering, pair classification, and retrieval modeled
on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but tailored to the nuances of
medical text. Our results demonstrate that this combined approach not only
establishes a robust evaluation framework but also yields embeddings that
consistently outperform state of the art alternatives in different tasks.

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between training data and model behavior
during pretraining is crucial, but existing workflows make this process
cumbersome, fragmented, and often inaccessible to researchers. We present
TokenSmith, an open-source library for interactive editing, inspection, and
analysis of datasets used in Megatron-style pretraining frameworks such as
GPT-NeoX, Megatron, and NVIDIA NeMo. TokenSmith supports a wide range of
operations including searching, viewing, ingesting, exporting, inspecting, and
sampling data, all accessible through a simple user interface and a modular
backend. It also enables structured editing of pretraining data without
requiring changes to training code, simplifying dataset debugging, validation,
and experimentation.
  TokenSmith is designed as a plug and play addition to existing large language
model pretraining workflows, thereby democratizing access to production-grade
dataset tooling. TokenSmith is hosted on GitHub1, with accompanying
documentation and tutorials. A demonstration video is also available on
YouTube.

TL;DR: GEPA 改善 LLM 的任务学习，通过自然语言反思提升效率，显著减少策略优化迭代，超越 GRPO 和 MIPROv2 的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的 LLMs 使用 RL 方法如 GRPO 进行任务适配，需要大量迭代。语言的可解释性提供了比稀疏标量奖励更丰富的学习媒介，因此提出了一种新的语言驱动的强化学习方法。

Method: 引入 GEPA（Genetic-Pareto）算法，该算法通过自然语言反思机制从试错中学习高阶规则，优化 LLM 的提示，从而改善 AI 系统中的任务表现。

Result: GEPA 在四个任务上平均比 GRPO 高出10%，最高可达20%，同时减少了迭代次数达35倍。GEPA 也超过了 MIPROv2 在两种 LLMs 上的表现，展示了其作为代码优化推理搜索策略的潜力。

Conclusion: GEPA 提升了 LLMs 在多任务中的学习效率，减少了大量的策略优化迭代。与 GRPO 和 MIPROv2 相比，GEPA 在多个任务中的表现优越，节省了大量的迭代步骤。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via
reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), which often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue
that the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer
learning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse,
scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt
optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn
high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or
more LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool
calls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose
problems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons
from the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it
can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four
tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up
to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer,
MIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an
inference-time search strategy for code optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了通过结合大推理模型和大动作模型来改善服务组合的可能性，提出了一种集成架构以促进自动化进程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 服务组合是构建自适应和智能软件系统的核心挑战，通常受限于有限的推理能力或脆弱的执行机制。

Method: 我们探讨了通过集成大语言模型实现的两种新兴范式：大推理模型（LRMs）和大动作模型（LAMs）。我们提出了一种集成LRM-LAM的体系架构框架，作为推进自动化服务组合的一个有希望的方向。

Result: 集成LRM和LAM的架构可以在动态执行工作流的同时对服务要求和约束进行推理，从而弥合意图与执行之间的差距。

Conclusion: 我们提出的LRM-LAM集成架构框架有望推进自动化服务组合，使其成为一个完全自动化、用户友好的过程，并由高级自然语言意图驱动。

Abstract: Service composition remains a central challenge in building adaptive and
intelligent software systems, often constrained by limited reasoning
capabilities or brittle execution mechanisms. This paper explores the
integration of two emerging paradigms enabled by large language models: Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) and Large Action Models (LAMs). We argue that LRMs
address the challenges of semantic reasoning and ecosystem complexity while
LAMs excel in dynamic action execution and system interoperability. However,
each paradigm has complementary limitations - LRMs lack grounded action
capabilities, and LAMs often struggle with deep reasoning. We propose an
integrated LRM-LAM architectural framework as a promising direction for
advancing automated service composition. Such a system can reason about service
requirements and constraints while dynamically executing workflows, thus
bridging the gap between intention and execution. This integration has the
potential to transform service composition into a fully automated,
user-friendly process driven by high-level natural language intent.

Motivation: 传统队列方法在处理动态和不确定环境时存在局限性，因此需要发展一种能应对这些挑战的强大RL方法。

Method: 提出了一种结合深度确定性策略梯度（DDPG）和Dyna风格规划的新型RL方法，称为Dyna-DDPG。该方法通过单独的预测模型来提高稳定性和样本效率。

Result: 实验结果显示，该框架能够快速学习有效的路由策略，并在中断情况下保持稳定的性能，同时可有效扩展到更大的网络规模。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了一种能够在复杂队列网络系统中优化路由决策的仿真驱动强化学习框架，特别适用于制造和通信领域。

Abstract: This study focuses on the development of a simulation-driven reinforcement
learning (RL) framework for optimizing routing decisions in complex queueing
network systems, with a particular emphasis on manufacturing and communication
applications. Recognizing the limitations of traditional queueing methods,
which often struggle with dynamic, uncertain environments, we propose a robust
RL approach leveraging Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) combined with
Dyna-style planning (Dyna-DDPG). The framework includes a flexible and
configurable simulation environment capable of modeling diverse queueing
scenarios, disruptions, and unpredictable conditions. Our enhanced Dyna-DDPG
implementation incorporates separate predictive models for next-state
transitions and rewards, significantly improving stability and sample
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments and rigorous evaluations demonstrate the
framework's capability to rapidly learn effective routing policies that
maintain robust performance under disruptions and scale effectively to larger
network sizes. Additionally, we highlight strong software engineering practices
employed to ensure reproducibility and maintainability of the framework,
enabling practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 解决AI系统在已知构件的基础上构建和理解新组合的能力不足的问题，通过模拟人类大脑的灵活性来实现这一目标。

Method: 使用MIRAGE框架进行系统化泛化，结合Transformer神经分解器和框架引擎进行模块交互以实现系统化任务处理。

Conclusion: MIRAGE模型通过结合大脑的不同功能模块，实现了系统化的组成操作，能够在新任务上表现出极高的准确率。

Abstract: Systematic compositional generalization - constructing and understanding
novel combinations of known building blocks - remains a core challenge for AI
systems. Human cognition achieves this flexibility via the interplay of the
hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC): the hippocampus rapidly encodes
episodes, and the prefrontal cortex consolidates them into reusable schemas for
reasoning. Drawing on these insights, we present MIRAGE (Meta-Inference with
Rules and Abstractions from Generalized Experience), a framework that achieves
systematic generalization on compositional tasks. MIRAGE has two interacting
modules mirroring the brain's deliberative HPC-PFC loop and intuitive
neocortical pattern recognition. (1) The meta-trained Transformer Neural
Decomposer, paralleling neocortical "System 1" computation, is trained on a
task-agnostic stream of randomly sampled compositional grammars and applies one
decomposition step per pass, with successive passes iteratively refining the
sequence representation. (2) The Schema Engine, analogous to the HPC-PFC
"System 2" loop, dynamically extracts, ranks, and applies reusable schemas,
storing variable bindings in episodic memory and expanding them when needed. By
explicitly equipping the Transformer component of MIRAGE with actively managed
schematic structures, our model performs systematic compositional operations
through explicit schema application and transformation, relying solely on
frozen weights when solving entirely novel tasks. This approach demonstrates
systematic compositional generalization on the SCAN benchmark, achieving > 99%
accuracy on all task splits with only 1.19M parameters in the transformer
module. Ablation studies confirm that MIRAGE's systematicity critically depends
on the quality of extracted schemas and the model's iterative refinement
process.

Motivation: 解决在高维任务（如类人运动）中部分可观测性下的有效策略学习问题。

Method: 引入了一种新的历史编码器，可并行处理固定长度的过去观测序列，并集成到标准无模型算法中进行决策。

Result: 学习到的策略使用原始状态的三分之一到三分之二，表现与完全状态访问的先进结果相当，且展现了对机器人属性的适应性。

Conclusion: 实现了在不完全状态信息下的有效强化学习策略，能够在Gymnasium Humanoid-v4环境中稳定训练并获得与全状态访问时相当的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to robotic control, but
effective policy learning under partial observability remains a major
challenge, especially in high-dimensional tasks like humanoid locomotion. To
date, no prior work has demonstrated stable training of humanoid policies with
incomplete state information in the benchmark Gymnasium Humanoid-v4
environment. The objective in this environment is to walk forward as fast as
possible without falling, with rewards provided for staying upright and moving
forward, and penalties incurred for excessive actions and external contact
forces. This research presents the first successful instance of learning under
partial observability in this environment. The learned policy achieves
performance comparable to state-of-the-art results with full state access,
despite using only one-third to two-thirds of the original states. Moreover,
the policy exhibits adaptability to robot properties, such as variations in
body part masses. The key to this success is a novel history encoder that
processes a fixed-length sequence of past observations in parallel. Integrated
into a standard model-free algorithm, the encoder enables performance on par
with fully observed baselines. We hypothesize that it reconstructs essential
contextual information from recent observations, thereby enabling robust
decision-making.

Motivation: 由于时间知识图（TKG）的不断演变，传统模型在训练过程中无法全面应对新知识的泛化与同化，以及处理连接稀疏的新实体的问题。

Method: 我们的方法结合了模型无关的增强层和加权采样策略，可与任何现有的时间知识图完成方法结合使用。

Conclusion: 我们的增量训练框架优于现有方法，在总链路预测、归纳链路预测以及处理长尾实体方面表现优异。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) completion models traditionally assume access
to the entire graph during training. This overlooks challenges stemming from
the evolving nature of TKGs, such as: (i) the model's requirement to generalize
and assimilate new knowledge, and (ii) the task of managing new or unseen
entities that often have sparse connections. In this paper, we present an
incremental training framework specifically designed for TKGs, aiming to
address entities that are either not observed during training or have sparse
connections. Our approach combines a model-agnostic enhancement layer with a
weighted sampling strategy, that can be augmented to and improve any existing
TKG completion method. The enhancement layer leverages a broader, global
definition of entity similarity, which moves beyond mere local neighborhood
proximity of GNN-based methods. The weighted sampling strategy employed in
training accentuates edges linked to infrequently occurring entities. We
evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that our
framework outperforms existing methods in total link prediction, inductive link
prediction, and in addressing long-tail entities. Notably, our method achieves
a 10\% improvement and a 15\% boost in MRR for these datasets. The results
underscore the potential of our approach in mitigating catastrophic forgetting
and enhancing the robustness of TKG completion methods, especially in an
incremental training context

Motivation: 当前数据驱动模型难以获取车道级的交通数据，限制了精确交通管理应用的发展。

Method: 设计了两阶段框架RoadDiff，利用道路-车道关联自编码器和车道扩散模块充分利用有限的时空依赖关系和道路数据的分布关系，准确推断出细粒度车道交通状态。

Result: 在不同路况的六个数据集上进行了广泛实验，验证了RoadDiff模型的有效性。

Conclusion: RoadDiff模型在解决细粒度道路交通推断任务方面表现良好。

Abstract: Fine-grained traffic management and prediction are fundamental to key
applications such as autonomous driving, lane change guidance, and traffic
signal control. However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a
critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and
number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To
address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task,
which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using
limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective
solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first
scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a
two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task.
This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the
Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies
and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained
lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline
models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive
experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate
the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The
relevant datasets and code are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了适用于多目标优化问题的新算法——Pareto-NRPA，并在多个测试中显示出优越的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NRPA算法仅适用于单目标问题，而多目标优化问题在离散搜索空间中的应用受到限制，因此需要开发新的算法来应对多目标优化问题。

Method: 提出一种新的蒙特卡洛算法——Pareto-NRPA，通过扩展NRPA算法的嵌套搜索和策略更新机制，使其适应于多目标优化问题。该算法使用一组策略同时探索解决方案空间的不同区域，并在每个搜索层面维护非支配前沿。

Result: 在测试中，Pareto-NRPA在旅行商问题的时间窗口双目标变体（MO-TSPTW）和神经架构搜索任务中表现良好，显示出与最先进的多目标算法相比具有竞争力的性能，尤其是在约束搜索空间中明显优于当前的多目标进化算法。

Conclusion: Pareto-NRPA能够在多目标优化中实现良好的收敛性和解的多样性，并且在一些受约束的搜索空间中优于现有算法，是NRPA在多目标设置中的首次应用。

Abstract: We introduce Pareto-NRPA, a new Monte-Carlo algorithm designed for
multi-objective optimization problems over discrete search spaces. Extending
the Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm originally formulated for
single-objective problems, Pareto-NRPA generalizes the nested search and policy
update mechanism to multi-objective optimization. The algorithm uses a set of
policies to concurrently explore different regions of the solution space and
maintains non-dominated fronts at each level of search. Policy adaptation is
performed with respect to the diversity and isolation of sequences within the
Pareto front. We benchmark Pareto-NRPA on two classes of problems: a novel
bi-objective variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows
problem (MO-TSPTW), and a neural architecture search task on well-known
benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Pareto-NRPA achieves competitive
performance against state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, both in terms
of convergence and diversity of solutions. Particularly, Pareto-NRPA strongly
outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective algorithms on
constrained search spaces. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first
adaptation of NRPA to the multi-objective setting.

Result: 实验表明，即使是最先进的具有VLM骨干的代理在涉及感知、推理和协调的高级任务时仍然表现出困难，强调了需要更深入地理解当前的优势和局限性，以推动计算机使用代理研究和部署的未来进展。

Conclusion: 需要对计算机代理的当前优势和局限性有更深入的理解，以推动未来进展。

Abstract: Computer-using agents have shown strong potential to boost human productivity
and enable new application forms across platforms. While recent advances have
led to usable applications, existing benchmarks fail to account for the
internal task heterogeneity and the corresponding agent capabilities, as well
as their alignment with actual user demands-hindering both targeted capability
development and the reliable transition of research progress into practical
deployment. To bridge the gap, we present OS-MAP, a benchmark for daily
computer-using automation that organizes its 416 realistic tasks across 15
applications along two key dimensions: a five-level taxonomy of automation and
a generalization scope derived from a real-world user demand hierarchy. To
enable fine-grained analysis of required capabilities and alignment with
real-world scenarios, OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation
level across a five-level taxonomy, and generalization scope across a demand
hierarchy. This design captures varying levels of required agent autonomy and
generalization, forming a performance-generalization evaluation matrix for
structured and comprehensive assessment. Experiments show that even
State-of-the-Art agents with VLM backbones struggle with higher-level tasks
involving perception, reasoning, and coordination-highlighting the need for a
deeper understanding of current strengths and limitations to drive the future
progress in computer-using agents research and deployment. All code,

Abstract: Robust and unobtrusive in-vehicle physiological monitoring is crucial for
ensuring driving safety and user experience. While remote physiological
measurement (RPM) offers a promising non-invasive solution, its translation to
real-world driving scenarios is critically constrained by the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets. Existing resources are often limited in scale, modality
diversity, the breadth of biometric annotations, and the range of captured
conditions, thereby omitting inherent real-world challenges in driving. Here,
we present PhysDrive, the first large-scale multimodal dataset for contactless
in-vehicle physiological sensing with dedicated consideration on various
modality settings and driving factors. PhysDrive collects data from 48 drivers,
including synchronized RGB, near-infrared camera, and raw mmWave radar data,
accompanied with six synchronized ground truths (ECG, BVP, Respiration, HR, RR,
and SpO2). It covers a wide spectrum of naturalistic driving conditions,
including driver motions, dynamic natural light, vehicle types, and road
conditions. We extensively evaluate both signal-processing and deep-learning
methods on PhysDrive, establishing a comprehensive benchmark across all
modalities, and release full open-source code with compatibility for mainstream
public toolboxes. We envision PhysDrive will serve as a foundational resource
and accelerate research on multimodal driver monitoring and smart-cockpit

Result: 数值实验表明，该算法在提升推理任务和组合数学问题上实现了数量级的速度提升。

Conclusion: 我们提出的算法显著加速了带有前驱关系的有序域上的提升推理任务，提供了一个数量级的速度提升。

Abstract: We investigate lifted inference on ordered domains with predecessor
relations, where the elements of the domain respect a total (cyclic) order, and
every element has a distinct (clockwise) predecessor. Previous work has
explored this problem through weighted first-order model counting (WFOMC),
which computes the weighted sum of models for a given first-order logic
sentence over a finite domain. In WFOMC, the order constraint is typically
encoded by the linear order axiom introducing a binary predicate in the
sentence to impose a linear ordering on the domain elements. The immediate and
second predecessor relations are then encoded by the linear order predicate.
Although WFOMC with the linear order axiom is theoretically tractable, existing
algorithms struggle with practical applications, particularly when the
predecessor relations are involved. In this paper, we treat predecessor
relations as a native part of the axiom and devise a novel algorithm that
inherently supports these relations. The proposed algorithm not only provides
an exponential speedup for the immediate and second predecessor relations,
which are known to be tractable, but also handles the general k-th predecessor
relations. The extensive experiments on lifted inference tasks and
combinatorics math problems demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm,
achieving speedups of a full order of magnitude.

Motivation: 由于AI模型的日益复杂和庞大，需要提供大量计算资源，而这些资源在许多真实世界应用场景中是不可用的。

Method: 知识嫁接通过将大型模型的精选特征移植到较小模型中，减少模型尺寸并增强模型的泛化能力。

Result: 新模型实现了88.54%的模型尺寸减少，并提升了模型的泛化能力，在验证集上取得了89.97%的准确性，并在未见测试数据上表现优异。

Conclusion: 知识嫁接是一种有效优化AI模型的新机制，能够在资源受限环境中提高模型性能并减少模型尺寸，使AI应用于更多实际场景。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to larger,
more complex models with numerous parameters that require substantial computing
power -- resources often unavailable in many real-world application scenarios.
Our paper addresses this challenge by introducing knowledge grafting, a novel
mechanism that optimizes AI models for resource-constrained environments by
transferring selected features (the scion) from a large donor model to a
smaller rootstock model. The approach achieves an 88.54% reduction in model
size (from 64.39 MB to 7.38 MB), while improving generalization capability of
the model. Our new rootstock model achieves 89.97% validation accuracy (vs.
donor's 87.47%), maintains lower validation loss (0.2976 vs. 0.5068), and
performs exceptionally well on unseen test data with 90.45% accuracy. It
addresses the typical size vs performance trade-off, and enables deployment of
AI frameworks on resource-constrained devices with enhanced performance. We
have tested our approach on an agricultural weed detection scenario, however,
it can be extended across various edge computing scenarios, potentially
accelerating AI adoption in areas with limited hardware/software support -- by
mirroring in a similar manner the horticultural grafting enables productive
cultivation in challenging agri-based environments.

TL;DR: 信念随机游戏模型简化状态估计，通过约束与概率信念模型在不完美信息游戏中表现出相似效果，约束模型可有效决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不完美信息游戏中，因游戏状态不全，智能体需依赖片面信息做出决策。为应对此挑战，提出信念随机游戏模型，让游戏模型自身承担状态估计工作。

Method: 研究了在隐藏棋子身份的游戏中使用两种方法表示信念：一种是使用约束满足问题的约束模型，另一种是利用信念传播的概率扩展来估计边缘概率。

Result: 通过在两种不同游戏中使用通用目的智能体评估了两种信念表示的影响，发现基于约束的信念与概率推理的结果相当，智能体性能表现差异极小。

Conclusion: 基于约束的信念状态在许多情况下可能已足够实现有效决策。

Abstract: In imperfect-information games, agents must make decisions based on partial
knowledge of the game state. The Belief Stochastic Game model addresses this
challenge by delegating state estimation to the game model itself. This allows
agents to operate on externally provided belief states, thereby reducing the
need for game-specific inference logic. This paper investigates two approaches
to represent beliefs in games with hidden piece identities: a constraint-based
model using Constraint Satisfaction Problems and a probabilistic extension
using Belief Propagation to estimate marginal probabilities. We evaluated the
impact of both representations using general-purpose agents across two
different games. Our findings indicate that constraint-based beliefs yield
results comparable to those of probabilistic inference, with minimal
differences in agent performance. This suggests that constraint-based belief
states alone may suffice for effective decision-making in many settings.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在社会模拟中的潜力和局限，从计算社会科学的角度进行分析。

Method: 综述LLM在多代理模拟框架中的应用，重点关注系统架构、规模和验证策略。讨论了Generative Agents (Smallville)和AgentSociety等项目的设计选择、经验基础和方法创新。

Abstract: This position paper examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
social simulation, analyzing both their potential and their limitations from a
computational social science perspective. The first part reviews recent
findings on the ability of LLMs to replicate key aspects of human cognition,
including Theory of Mind reasoning and social inference, while also
highlighting significant limitations such as cognitive biases, lack of true
understanding, and inconsistencies in behavior. The second part surveys
emerging applications of LLMs in multi-agent simulation frameworks, focusing on
system architectures, scale, and validation strategies. Notable projects such
as Generative Agents (Smallville) and AgentSociety are discussed in terms of
their design choices, empirical grounding, and methodological innovations.
Particular attention is given to the challenges of behavioral fidelity,
calibration, and reproducibility in large-scale LLM-driven simulations. The
final section distinguishes between contexts where LLMs, like other black-box
systems, offer direct value-such as interactive simulations and serious
games-and those where their use is more problematic, notably in explanatory or
predictive modeling. The paper concludes by advocating for hybrid approaches
that integrate LLMs into traditional agent-based modeling platforms (GAMA,
Netlogo, etc), enabling modelers to combine the expressive flexibility of
language-based reasoning with the transparency and analytical rigor of
classical rule-based systems.

Motivation: 构建能够执行符号算法的神经系统是人工智能领域的一个开放性难题，尤其是在实现强泛化和超出分布的性能时更是如此。

Method: 引入了一种用于学习收敛的项重写系统的通用框架，并使用神经符号架构来实现，受重写算法本身启发。

Conclusion: 在多个任务中评估这些架构，尤其是数学公式简化任务中表现优异，并在多领域学习场景下表现出多任务处理能力，显著优于两个强大的神经基线：最近设计用于解决算法问题的Transformer变体Neural Data Router和通用大型语言模型GPT-4o，同时在推理基准测试中匹敌或优于OpenAI最新的o1-preview模型。

Abstract: Building neural systems that can learn to execute symbolic algorithms is a
challenging open problem in artificial intelligence, especially when aiming for
strong generalization and out-of-distribution performance. In this work, we
introduce a general framework for learning convergent term rewriting systems
using a neuro-symbolic architecture inspired by the rewriting algorithm itself.
We present two modular implementations of such architecture: the Neural
Rewriting System (NRS) and the Fast Neural Rewriting System (FastNRS). As a
result of algorithmic-inspired design and key architectural elements, both
models can generalize to out-of-distribution instances, with FastNRS offering
significant improvements in terms of memory efficiency, training speed, and
inference time. We evaluate both architectures on four tasks involving the
simplification of mathematical formulas and further demonstrate their
versatility in a multi-domain learning scenario, where a single model is
trained to solve multiple types of problems simultaneously. The proposed system
significantly outperforms two strong neural baselines: the Neural Data Router,
a recent transformer variant specifically designed to solve algorithmic
problems, and GPT-4o, one of the most powerful general-purpose large-language
models. Moreover, our system matches or outperforms the latest o1-preview model
from OpenAI that excels in reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a new Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning method that improves scalability and effectiveness in infrastructure budgeting and maintenance, proving superior to existing methods in case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of existing methods in managing infrastructure assets, especially under constraints like combinatorial action spaces, diverse asset deterioration, and environmental uncertainty.

Method: The paper introduces a Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning approach, which separates budget planning and asset prioritization into high-level and low-level tasks. It incorporates linear programming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework.

Result: The proposed methodology demonstrated faster convergence, better scalability, and the ability to deliver near-optimal solutions in varying sizes of sewer networks when compared to conventional Deep Q-Learning and enhanced genetic algorithms.

Conclusion: Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning methodology effectively enhances the scalability of budget planning and maintenance optimization for infrastructure asset management under complex conditions.

Abstract: Budget planning and maintenance optimization are crucial for infrastructure
asset management, ensuring cost-effectiveness and sustainability. However, the
complexity arising from combinatorial action spaces, diverse asset
deterioration, stringent budget constraints, and environmental uncertainty
significantly limits existing methods' scalability. This paper proposes a
Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning methodology specifically tailored to
multi-year infrastructure planning. Our approach decomposes the problem into
two hierarchical levels: a high-level Budget Planner allocating annual budgets
within explicit feasibility bounds, and a low-level Maintenance Planner
prioritizing assets within the allocated budget. By structurally separating
macro-budget decisions from asset-level prioritization and integrating linear
programming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework, the
method efficiently addresses exponential growth in the action space and ensures
rigorous budget compliance. A case study evaluating sewer networks of varying
sizes (10, 15, and 20 sewersheds) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. Compared to conventional Deep Q-Learning and enhanced genetic
algorithms, our methodology converges more rapidly, scales effectively, and
consistently delivers near-optimal solutions even as network size grows.

TL;DR: 通过使用共享的内容特征，减少模型大小，同时提高推荐系统的准确性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的下一项推荐系统训练需要为每个项目学习独特的嵌入，这可能消耗模型的大部分可训练参数。共享嵌入（例如使用内容信息）可以减少需要存储在内存中的嵌入数。

Method: 使用共享的基于内容的信息来减少内存中存储的不同嵌入数量，从而创建更轻量级的模型。使用两个音乐推荐数据集进行实验，包括在音乐流服务上的在线A/B测试。

Result: 使用共享的基于内容的特征能够在减少模型大小的同时提高推荐系统的准确性和多样性。

Conclusion: 通过使用共享的基于内容的特征（“语义ID”），可以在提高推荐准确性和多样性的同时减少模型的大小。

Abstract: Training recommender systems for next-item recommendation often requires
unique embeddings to be learned for each item, which may take up most of the
trainable parameters for a model. Shared embeddings, such as using content
information, can reduce the number of distinct embeddings to be stored in
memory. This allows for a more lightweight model; correspondingly, model
complexity can be increased due to having fewer embeddings to store in memory.
We show the benefit of using shared content-based features ('semantic IDs') in
improving recommendation accuracy and diversity, while reducing model size, for
two music recommendation datasets, including an online A/B test on a music
streaming service.

Motivation: 现代推荐系统中信息提取至关重要，而大语言模型及其相关的基于代理的框架在自动化信息提取方面具有显著优势。然而，这些多任务框架在数据中心研究中的应用仍未得到充分开发。

Method: 本文提出了Agent0，利用大语言模型驱动的基于代理系统，从原始非结构化文本中自动进行信息提取和特征构建。它通过协调一组交互的大语言模型代理自动识别文本中最有价值的方面。此外，还提供了一种利用动态反馈循环的自动化提示工程调优方法。

Conclusion: Agent0在自动化信息提取和特征构建方面有助于推荐系统的开发，通过其自动化提示工程方法提高了特征发现效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their associated agent-based frameworks have
significantly advanced automated information extraction, a critical component
of modern recommender systems. While these multitask frameworks are widely used
in code generation, their application in data-centric research is still largely
untapped. This paper presents Agent0, an LLM-driven, agent-based system
designed to automate information extraction and feature construction from raw,
unstructured text. Categorical features are crucial for large-scale recommender
systems but are often expensive to acquire. Agent0 coordinates a group of
interacting LLM agents to automatically identify the most valuable text aspects
for subsequent tasks (such as models or AutoML pipelines). Beyond its feature
engineering capabilities, Agent0 also offers an automated prompt-engineering
tuning method that utilizes dynamic feedback loops from an oracle. Our findings
demonstrate that this closed-loop methodology is both practical and effective
for automated feature discovery, which is recognized as one of the most
challenging phases in current recommender system development.

TL;DR: SelfRACG通过让LLMs表达信息需求，改善检索增强代码生成的性能，比传统方法优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强代码生成方法中，外部检索模块基于内容匹配，无法满足LLMs生成后续代码片段的具体信息需求，导致性能下降。

Method: SelfRACG包含一个信息需求表达模块和一个双阶段信息需求引导训练策略，以鼓励大型语言模型表达其信息需求。

Result: 实验表明，SelfRACG能够检索到与LLM信息需求更匹配的外部知识，生成性能较传统RACG更好。

Conclusion: SelfRACG通过让大型语言模型表达其信息需求，从而改进检索增强代码生成，相比于传统RACG，其生成性能更优。

Abstract: Existing retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) methods typically use an
external retrieval module to fetch semantically similar code snippets used for
generating subsequent fragments. However, even for consecutive code fragments,
the content often diverges due to logical progression, resulting in a content
gap. This gap undermines the performance of current RACG methods, as
\textit{external} retrieval modules based on content matching fail to infer the
specific information need of LLMs to generate the next code fragment.
Therefore, we propose \textbf{SelfRACG}, a novel paradigm that enables large
language models (LLMs) to \textbf{Self}-express their information needs to
enhance \textbf{RACG}. Specifically, SelfRACG includes an information need
expression module and a two-stage information need-guided training strategy,
which encourages LLMs to express their information need. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SelfRACG can retrieve external knowledge that better aligns
with the LLM's own information needs, resulting in superior generation
performance compared to vanilla RACG.

TL;DR: 本文提出了PBiLoss损失函数以减少推荐系统中的流行偏差，并通过实验验证了其在提升公平性和保持推荐准确性方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统中的流行偏差问题导致内容多样性减少和公平性受损。本文旨在通过提出新的模型来解决这种偏差。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的正则化损失函数PBiLoss，通过惩罚模型对流行项目的偏好来显式减少流行偏差。我们还引入了两个采样策略：流行正项（PopPos）和流行负项（PopNeg），以及两种区分流行项目的方法，分别基于固定的流行度阈值和无阈值的方法。

Result: 实验结果显示，PBiLoss显著改善了推荐系统的公平性，并在多种真实世界数据集上减少了用户的流行度-排名相关性（PRU）和项目的流行度-排名相关性（PRI），同时保持或提升了推荐准确性和排名性能。

Conclusion: PBiLoss有效地改善了推荐系统的公平性，同时保持甚至提高了标准的推荐准确性和排名指标。该方法提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，能够在准确性和平等内容曝光之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Recommender systems, especially those based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
have achieved remarkable success in capturing user-item interaction patterns.
However, they remain susceptible to popularity bias--the tendency to
over-recommend popular items--resulting in reduced content diversity and
compromised fairness. In this paper, we propose PBiLoss, a novel
regularization-based loss function designed to counteract popularity bias in
graph-based recommender models explicitly. PBiLoss augments traditional
training objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items,
thereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more
personalized content. We introduce two sampling strategies: Popular Positive
(PopPos) and Popular Negative (PopNeg), which respectively modulate the
contribution of the positive and negative popular items during training. We
further explore two methods to distinguish popular items: one based on a fixed
popularity threshold and another without any threshold, making the approach
flexible and adaptive. Our proposed method is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art graph-based frameworks such as
LightGCN and its variants. Comprehensive experiments across multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate that PBiLoss significantly improves fairness, as
demonstrated by reductions in the Popularity-Rank Correlation for Users (PRU)
and Popularity-Rank Correlation for Items (PRI), while maintaining or even
enhancing standard recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics. These results
highlight the effectiveness of directly embedding fairness objectives into the
optimization process, providing a practical and scalable solution for balancing
accuracy and equitable content exposure in modern recommender systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating retrieved information. Standard retrieval process prioritized
relevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In
contrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the
usefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical
evidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high
computational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of
passages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries
requiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to
distill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient
models. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking,
enabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the
need for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer
generation and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window
method that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate
that utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution
for RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer
quality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher
model for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into
RankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B. Our findings indicate that for complex
questions, utility-based selection is more effective than relevance ranking in
enhancing answer generation performance. We will release the relevance ranking
and utility-based selection annotations for the MS MARCO dataset, supporting
further research in this area.

Abstract: In contrast to single-user recommender systems, group recommender systems are
designed to generate and explain recommendations for groups. This
group-oriented setting introduces additional complexities, as several factors -
absent in individual contexts - must be addressed. These include understanding
group dynamics (e.g., social dependencies within the group), defining effective
decision-making processes, ensuring that recommendations are suitable for all
group members, and providing group-level explanations as well as explanations
for individual users. In this paper, we analyze in which way large language
models (LLMs) can support these aspects and help to increase the overall
decision support quality and applicability of group recommender systems.

Conclusion: 将检索到的段落纳入大型语言模型的推理过程，可以有效提升系统对抗噪声信息的能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to augment large
language models (LLMs) with external knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, its effectiveness is often undermined by the presence of noisy (i.e.,
low-quality) retrieved passages. Enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is
critical for improving the reliability of RAG systems. Recent advances have
equipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing
them to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by
this ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that
explicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming
to enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We
validate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the
retriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA
datasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG
performance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise,
where the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise,
where it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently
improves robustness. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can
also effectively leverage helpful passages. These findings suggest that
incorporating passages in LLMs' reasoning process is a promising direction for
building more robust RAG systems. The code can be found

Result: 这种方法在多个数据集和模态下实现了一致性的性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过引入一个可训练的小偏差，解决了冷启动问题中内容嵌入直接使用或过度微调带来的性能不佳问题。

Abstract: Many sequential recommender systems suffer from the cold start problem, where
items with few or no interactions cannot be effectively used by the model due
to the absence of a trained embedding. Content-based approaches, which leverage
item metadata, are commonly used in such scenarios. One possible way is to use
embeddings derived from content features such as textual descriptions as
initialization for the model embeddings. However, directly using frozen content
embeddings often results in suboptimal performance, as they may not fully adapt
to the recommendation task. On the other hand, fine-tuning these embeddings can
degrade performance for cold-start items, as item representations may drift far
from their original structure after training. We propose a novel approach to
address this limitation. Instead of entirely freezing the content embeddings or
fine-tuning them extensively, we introduce a small trainable delta to frozen
embeddings that enables the model to adapt item representations without letting
them go too far from their original semantic structure. This approach
demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple datasets and modalities,
including e-commerce datasets with textual descriptions and a music dataset
with audio-based representation.

Abstract: Single-pixel imaging has emerged as a key technique in fluorescence
microscopy, where fast acquisition and reconstruction are crucial. In this
context, images are reconstructed from linearly compressed measurements. In
practice, total variation minimisation is still used to reconstruct the image
from noisy measurements of the inner product between orthogonal sampling
pattern vectors and the original image data. However, data can be leveraged to
learn the measurement vectors and the reconstruction process, thereby enhancing
compression, reconstruction quality, and speed. We train an autoencoder through
self-supervision to learn an encoder (or measurement matrix) and a decoder. We
then test it on physically acquired multispectral and intensity data. During
acquisition, the learned encoder becomes part of the physical device. Our
approach can enhance single-pixel imaging in fluorescence microscopy by
reducing reconstruction time by two orders of magnitude, achieving superior
image quality, and enabling multispectral reconstructions. Ultimately, learned
single-pixel fluorescence microscopy could advance diagnosis and biological
research, providing multispectral imaging at a fraction of the cost.

Abstract: We propose image-to-image diffusion models that are designed to enhance the
realism and details of generated brain images by introducing sharp edges, fine
textures, subtle anatomical features, and imaging noise. Generative models have
been widely adopted in the biomedical domain, especially in image generation
applications. Latent diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art results in
generating brain MRIs. However, due to latent compression, generated images
from these models are overly smooth, lacking fine anatomical structures and
scan acquisition noise that are typically seen in real images. This work
formulates the realism enhancing and detail adding process as image-to-image
diffusion models, which refines the quality of LDM-generated images. We employ
commonly used metrics like FID and LPIPS for image realism assessment.
Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to demonstrate the realism of images
generated by RealDeal in terms of image noise distribution, sharpness, and
texture.

TL;DR: 对自动针重建的后处理阶段进行了改进，以解决分割阶段的错误问题，提高了重建精度，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像引导的近距离放射治疗需要针的重建，手动注释针对医疗专业人员来说是一项困难且耗时的任务。深度学习模型虽然在分割方面表现有效，但其结果常含有错误。当前不存在能够处理所有分割错误的鲁棒性后处理技术。

Method: 提出对现有的后处理技术进行适应性改进，以处理分割错误，从而改善重建精度。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的改进措施能够有效管理分割错误，最佳改进的后处理技术在测试集中实现了针尖和针末端点定位误差的中值为1.07 mm和0.43 mm，针轴误差的中值为0.75 mm，且无误报和漏报针。

Conclusion: 对现有的后处理技术进行改进，可以有效处理分割错误，从而提高针状结构的重建精度。

Abstract: Brachytherapy involves bringing a radioactive source near tumor tissue using
implanted needles. Image-guided brachytherapy planning requires amongst others,
the reconstruction of the needles. Manually annotating these needles on patient
images can be a challenging and time-consuming task for medical professionals.
For automatic needle reconstruction, a two-stage pipeline is commonly adopted,
comprising a segmentation stage followed by a post-processing stage. While deep
learning models are effective for segmentation, their results often contain
errors. No currently existing post-processing technique is robust to all
possible segmentation errors. We therefore propose adaptations to existing
post-processing techniques mainly aimed at dealing with segmentation errors and
thereby improving the reconstruction accuracy. Experiments on a prostate cancer
dataset, based on MRI scans annotated by medical professionals, demonstrate
that our proposed adaptations can help to effectively manage segmentation
errors, with the best adapted post-processing technique achieving median
needle-tip and needle-bottom point localization errors of $1.07$ (IQR $\pm
1.04$) mm and $0.43$ (IQR $\pm 0.46$) mm, respectively, and median shaft error
of $0.75$ (IQR $\pm 0.69$) mm with 0 false positive and 0 false negative
needles on a test set of 261 needles.

TL;DR: 提出双路径学习模型（DPL），改进医疗图像去噪效果，在多种模式和噪声下展现稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去噪方法依赖于单一的噪声特性或图像的上下文信息，且通常针对单一成像模式和噪声类型开发及评估。

Method: 双路径学习模型架构（DPL），通过结合噪声和上下文信息进行去噪处理。

Result: DPL在高斯噪声下比基线UNet的PSNR提高了3.35%。

Conclusion: DPL模型展现出在多种成像模式和噪声类型下的稳健性和普适性。

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a critical role in modern healthcare, enabling
clinicians to accurately diagnose diseases and develop effective treatment
plans. However, noise, often introduced by imaging devices, can degrade image
quality, leading to misinterpretation and compromised clinical outcomes.
Existing denoising approaches typically rely either on noise characteristics or
on contextual information from the image. Moreover, they are commonly developed
and evaluated for a single imaging modality and noise type. Motivated by Geng
et.al CNCL, which integrates both noise and context, this study introduces a
Dual-Pathway Learning (DPL) model architecture that effectively denoises
medical images by leveraging both sources of information and fusing them to
generate the final output. DPL is evaluated across multiple imaging modalities
and various types of noise, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
DPL improves PSNR by 3.35% compared to the baseline UNet when evaluated on
Gaussian noise and trained across all modalities. The code is available at

Abstract: Mammography is the most commonly used imaging modality for breast cancer
screening, driving an increasing demand for deep-learning techniques to support
large-scale analysis. However, the development of accurate and robust methods
is often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in
lesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for
data synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize
lesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In
this paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel
framework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and
localized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,
where the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that
represents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical
coherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize
lesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that
guides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most
relevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing
their interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise
control over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of
synthesized mammograms. These advancements position GCDM as a promising tool
for clinical applications in mammogram synthesis. Our code is available at

Motivation: 准确分割和量化慢性阻塞性肺疾病（COPD）患者的肺部血管，特别是小血管，对CT影像分析至关重要。

Method: 本文提出了一种使用教师-学生模型的自我训练框架来进行肺血管分割。首先，通过交互方式获取高质量的注释，然后以半监督方式训练模型。完全监督的模型在一小部分标注CT图像上训练，生成教师模型。接着，使用教师模型为未标注的CT图像生成伪标签，并根据某种策略选择可靠的伪标签参与学生模型的训练。这个训练过程反复进行，直到达到最佳性能。

Abstract: Background: It is fundamental for accurate segmentation and quantification of
the pulmonary vessel, particularly smaller vessels, from computed tomography
(CT) images in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.
Objective: The aim of this study was to segment the pulmonary vasculature using
a semi-supervised method. Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is
proposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of
pulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the
in-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the
semi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of
labeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher
model is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which
reliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the
student model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is
iteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:
Extensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD
patients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed
method, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by
2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is
conducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the
differences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease.
Conclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of
pulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis. The
code will be made available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to efficiently exploit long-range dependencies and diverse context information in learned image compression across different coding steps.

Method: HPCM employs a hierarchical coding schedule to sequentially model dependencies among latents at multiple scales, with a progressive context fusion mechanism to integrate contextual information from previous coding steps.

Result: Our method demonstrates superior rate-distortion performance, effectively balancing compression quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: HPCM achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance and effectively balances compression performance with computational complexity.

Abstract: Context modeling is essential in learned image compression for accurately
estimating the distribution of latents. While recent advanced methods have
expanded context modeling capacity, they still struggle to efficiently exploit
long-range dependency and diverse context information across different coding
steps. In this paper, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Progressive Context
Model (HPCM) for more efficient context information acquisition. Specifically,
HPCM employs a hierarchical coding schedule to sequentially model the
contextual dependencies among latents at multiple scales, which enables more
efficient long-range context modeling. Furthermore, we propose a progressive
context fusion mechanism that incorporates contextual information from previous
coding steps into the current step, effectively exploiting diverse contextual
information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance and strikes a better balance
between compression performance and computational complexity. The code is

Abstract: In medical imaging, generative models are increasingly relied upon for two
distinct but equally critical tasks: reconstruction, where the goal is to
restore medical imaging (usually inverse problems like inpainting or
superresolution), and generation, where synthetic data is created to augment
datasets or carry out counterfactual analysis. Despite shared architecture and
learning frameworks, they prioritize different goals: generation seeks high
perceptual quality and diversity, while reconstruction focuses on data fidelity
and faithfulness. In this work, we introduce a "generative model zoo" and
systematically analyze how modern latent diffusion models and autoregressive
models navigate the reconstruction-generation spectrum. We benchmark a suite of
generative models across representative cardiac medical imaging tasks, focusing
on image inpainting with varying masking ratios and sampling strategies, as
well as unconditional image generation. Our findings show that diffusion models
offer superior perceptual quality for unconditional generation but tend to
hallucinate as masking ratios increase, whereas autoregressive models maintain
stable perceptual performance across masking levels, albeit with generally
lower fidelity.

TL;DR: ULS23模型在长时间数据中的分割性能下降，研究表明需要转向更具集成性的时间分析模型以确保肿瘤的稳健跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动化工具在处理中长时间变化过程中往往难以保持时间上的一致性。因此，虽然一些通用病灶分割模型在单一时间节点上有所进展，但在长时间数据分析上表现不佳。

Method: 使用公共临床数据集中的基线和后续CT扫描，对ULS23分割模型在长时间情况下的性能进行评估，并通过人为地偏移输入体积以反映真实病灶中心来进行对照试验，以系统地探测模型脆弱性。

Result: 实验结果表明，模型性能高度依赖于病灶中心的假设；当病灶发生显著偏移时，分割准确性迅速下降。

Conclusion: 单一时间点模型在长时间数据中的应用存在基本局限性。为实现稳健的肿瘤跟踪，需要从单一目的工具转向集成的、端到端的，固有设计用于时间分析的模型。

Abstract: Longitudinal lesion analysis is crucial for oncological care, yet automated
tools often struggle with temporal consistency. While universal lesion
segmentation models have advanced, they are typically designed for single time
points. This paper investigates the performance of the ULS23 segmentation model
in a longitudinal context. Using a public clinical dataset of baseline and
follow-up CT scans, we evaluated the model's ability to segment and track
lesions over time. We identified two critical, interconnected failure modes: a
sharp degradation in segmentation quality in follow-up cases due to inter-scan
registration errors, and a subsequent breakdown of the lesion correspondence
process. To systematically probe this vulnerability, we conducted a controlled
experiment where we artificially displaced the input volume relative to the
true lesion center. Our results demonstrate that the model's performance is
highly dependent on its assumption of a centered lesion; segmentation accuracy
collapses when the lesion is sufficiently displaced. These findings reveal a
fundamental limitation of applying single-timepoint models to longitudinal
data. We conclude that robust oncological tracking requires a paradigm shift
away from cascading single-purpose tools towards integrated, end-to-end models
inherently designed for temporal analysis.

Result: 我们的方法能够从少至三个血管造影视图中生成合理的重建结果。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在训练时间和重建精度方面优于现有的工作。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) and dynamic 3D+time (4D) reconstruction of coronary
arteries from X-ray coronary angiography (CA) has the potential to improve
clinical procedures. However, there are multiple challenges to be addressed,
most notably, blood-vessel structure sparsity, poor background and blood vessel
distinction, sparse-views, and intra-scan motion. State-of-the-art
reconstruction approaches rely on time-consuming manual or error-prone
automatic segmentations, limiting clinical usability. Recently, approaches
based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown promise for automatic
reconstructions in the sparse-view setting. However, they suffer from long
training times due to their dependence on MLP-based representations. We propose
NerT-CA, a hybrid approach of Neural and Tensorial representations for
accelerated 4D reconstructions with sparse-view CA. Building on top of the
previous NeRF-based work, we model the CA scene as a decomposition of low-rank
and sparse components, utilizing fast tensorial fields for low-rank static
reconstruction and neural fields for dynamic sparse reconstruction. Our
approach outperforms previous works in both training time and reconstruction
accuracy, yielding reasonable reconstructions from as few as three angiogram
views. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively on
representative 4D phantom datasets.
