While typical instantiations of this task\nassume that the user's target item will (eventually) be returned, this might\noften not be true, for example, the item the user seeks is not within the item\ncatalogue. Failing to return a user's desired item can lead to user\nfrustration, as the user needs to interact with the system for an increased\nnumber of turns. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we introduce the task\nof Supervised Conversational Performance Prediction, inspired by Query\nPerformance Prediction (QPP) for predicting effectiveness in response to a\nsearch engine query. In this regard, we propose predictors for conversational\nperformance that detect conversation failures using multi-turn semantic\ninformation contained in the embedded representations of retrieved image items.\nSpecifically, our AutoEncoder-based predictor learns a compressed\nrepresentation of top-retrieved items of the train turns and uses the\nclassification labels to predict the evaluation turn. Our evaluation scenario\naddressed two recommendation scenarios, by differentiating between system\nfailure, where the system is unable to find the target, and catalogue failure,\nwhere the target does not exist in the item catalogue. In our experiments using\nthe Shoes and FashionIQ Dresses datasets, we measure the accuracy of predictors\nfor both system and catalogue failures. Our results demonstrate the promise of\nour proposed predictors for predicting system failures (existing evaluation\nscenario), while we detect a considerable decrease in predictive performance in\nthe case of catalogue failure prediction (when inducing a missing item\nscenario) compared to system failures."}

The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on\nhighly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques\nare actively studied in the research community, the real-world model\ndevelopment still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled\naccess. Users of such systems should have the right to choose \\emph{not} to\nshare highly sensitive interactions.

We propose a\nmembership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to\nmeasure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS\ninteraction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential\nprivacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method.

In the multimodal recommendation\n(MMRec) field, training GCNs requires more expensive time and space costs and\nexacerbates the gap between different modalities, resulting in sub-optimal\nrecommendation accuracy. This paper critically points out the inherent\nchallenges associated with adopting GCNs during the training phase in MMRec,\nrevealing that GCNs inevitably create unhelpful and even harmful pairs during\nmodel optimization and isolate different modalities. To this end, we propose\nFastMMRec, a highly efficient multimodal recommendation framework that deploys\ngraph convolutions exclusively during the testing phase, bypassing their use in\ntraining. We demonstrate that adopting GCNs solely in the testing phase\nsignificantly improves the model's efficiency and scalability while alleviating\nthe modality isolation problem often caused by using GCNs during the training\nphase.
