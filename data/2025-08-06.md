Abstract: Recently, a significant improvement in the accuracy of 3D human pose
estimation has been achieved by combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
with pyramid grid alignment feedback loops. Additionally, innovative
breakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the
adoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these
advancements, this study aims to deeply optimize and improve the existing Pymaf
network architecture. The main innovations of this paper include: (1)
Introducing a Transformer feature extraction network layer based on
self-attention mechanisms to enhance the capture of low-level features; (2)
Enhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences
through feature temporal fusion techniques; (3) Implementing spatial pyramid
structures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature
representations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model
obtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW
datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed improvement strategies
significantly enhance the network's detection capability in human pose
estimation, further advancing the development of human pose estimation
technology.

*Tongchun Zuo,Zaiyu Huang,Shuliang Ning,Ente Lin,Chao Liang,Zerong Zheng,Jianwen Jiang,Yuan Zhang,Mingyuan Gao,Xin Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出DreamVVT框架，通过两阶段方法提高视频虚拟试穿技术的细节保持和时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在详尽服装细节保持和时间连续性方面的困难。

Method: DreamVVT框架包含两个阶段：第一阶段使用多帧试穿模型和视觉语言模型进行高保真关键帧图像合成；第二阶段从输入内容提取骨架地图和细粒度运动及外观描述，结合关键帧试穿图像输入到预训练的视频生成模型。

Result: DreamVVT成功在真实场景中利用未配对的人体数据增强适应性，并确保新区域长期时间一致性。

Conclusion: DreamVVT框架在保持细致服装内容和时间稳定性方面超过了现有方法。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on (VVT) technology has garnered considerable academic
interest owing to its promising applications in e-commerce advertising and
entertainment. However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce
paired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of
advanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to
accurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal
consistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
DreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired
human-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further
leverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the
first stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a
multi-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to
synthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.
These images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video
generation. \textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with
fine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input
content, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a
pretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures
long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible
dynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content
and temporal stability in real-world scenarios. Our project page

### [3] [Elucidating the Role of Feature Normalization in IJEPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02829)
*Adam Colton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 用DynTanh代替特征层归一化，可提高IJEPA模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出特征层归一化会扰乱视觉标记的自然能量层次，从而阻止模型优先考虑语义丰富的区域，因此需要替代。

Method: 将IJEPA模型中的特征层归一化替换为DynTanh激活，以更好地保持视觉标记的能量。

Result: IJEPA模型在使用DynTanh后，ImageNet线性探测准确率从38％提高到42.7％，在NYU Depth V2的单目深度估计中RMSE减少0.08。

Conclusion: 保持特征的自然能量层次对于有效的自监督视觉表征学习至关重要。

Abstract: In the standard image joint embedding predictive architecture (IJEPA),
features at the output of the teacher encoder are layer normalized (LN) before
serving as a distillation target for the student encoder and predictor. We
propose that this feature normalization disrupts the natural energy hierarchy
of visual tokens, where high-energy tokens (those with larger L2 norms) encode
semantically important image regions. LN forces all features to have identical
L2 norms, effectively equalizing their energies and preventing the model from
prioritizing semantically rich regions. We find that IJEPA models trained with
feature LN exhibit loss maps with significant checkerboard-like artifacts. We
propose that feature LN be replaced with a DynTanh activation as the latter
better preserves token energies and allows high-energy tokens to greater
contribute to the prediction loss. We show that IJEPA trained with feature
DynTanh exhibits a longer-tailed loss distribution and fixes the checkerboard
artifacts in the loss map. Our empirical results show that our simple
modification improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy from 38% to 42.7% for
ViT-Small and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2 monocular depth estimation.
These results suggest that preserving natural token energies is crucial for
effective self-supervised visual representation learning.

### [4] [GENIE: Gaussian Encoding for Neural Radiance Fields Interactive Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02831)
*Mikołaj Zieliński,Krzysztof Byrski,Tomasz Szczepanik,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENIE结合NeRF和GS的优点，实现了更高效直观的场景编辑与渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF的隐式编码使编辑和物理交互具有挑战性，而GS虽易于操控但渲染质量有限，因而需要一个结合两者优点的模型。

Method: GENIE采用可训练的特征嵌入来替代利用球面调和对外观进行建模，并使用光线追踪高斯邻近搜索（RT-GPS）来快速查找最近高斯，再通过多分辨率哈希网格初始化和更新高斯特征。

Result: GENIE可实时进行局部感知的编辑，作为高斯元被重新定位或修改，其插值影响可立即反映在渲染输出中。

Conclusion: GENIE模型通过结合NeRF的高写实性渲染质量和GS的可编辑及结构化表示，实现了场景的直观编辑、动态交互及与物理仿真的兼容性。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have recently
transformed 3D scene representation and rendering. NeRF achieves high-fidelity
novel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural
networks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction
challenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of
Gaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more
intuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly
well-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based
simulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural
Radiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the
photorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured
representation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance
modeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These
embeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest
Gaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we
introduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest
Gaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a
multi-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.
Together, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as
Gaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence
is immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of
implicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene
manipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,
bridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering. The code
can be found under (https://github.com/MikolajZielinski/genie)

### [5] [RefineSeg: Dual Coarse-to-Fine Learning for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02844)
*Anghong Du,Nay Aung,Theodoros N. Arvanitis,Stefan K. Piechnik,Joao A C Lima,Steffen E. Petersen,Le Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的粗到细分割框架，依赖粗糙的目标和互补标注，通过引入过渡矩阵和联合训练来提升分割精度，实验结果超越弱监督方法，接近全监督表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的像素级医学图像注释对于监督分割任务至关重要，而获得这些注释成本高昂且需要医学专业知识。

Method: 引入过渡矩阵以建模粗糙注释中的不准确和不完整区域，通过联合训练多个粗糙注释集，逐步改善网络输出，从而推断出真实分割分布。

Result: 在两个公开的心脏影像数据集ACDC和MSCMRseg上展示结果，并进一步评估其在英国Biobank数据集上的性能。方法在实验中展现出优越性，超越了最先进的弱监督方法，逼近完全监督方法。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，我们的方法不仅在性能上超过了现有的弱监督方法，而且接近于完全监督方法的表现。

Abstract: High-quality pixel-level annotations of medical images are essential for
supervised segmentation tasks, but obtaining such annotations is costly and
requires medical expertise. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
coarse-to-fine segmentation framework that relies entirely on coarse-level
annotations, encompassing both target and complementary drawings, despite their
inherent noise. The framework works by introducing transition matrices in order
to model the inaccurate and incomplete regions in the coarse annotations. By
jointly training on multiple sets of coarse annotations, it progressively
refines the network's outputs and infers the true segmentation distribution,
achieving a robust approximation of precise labels through matrix-based
modeling. To validate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method,
we demonstrate the results on two public cardiac imaging datasets, ACDC and
MSCMRseg, and further evaluate its performance on the UK Biobank dataset.
Experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art
weakly supervised methods and closely matches the fully supervised approach.

### [6] [MIDAR: Mimicking LiDAR Detection for Traffic Applications with a Lightweight Plug-and-Play Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02858)
*Tianheng Zhu,Yiheng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIDAR是一种利用细化视线图和GRU增强型APPNP架构的模型，提升了交通模拟中LiDAR检测的真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大规模真实世界自动驾驶车辆部署的不可行性，研究集中于多个自动驾驶车辆合作感知数据的利用，而现有模拟器在多AV场景下面临挑战。

Method: MIDAR使用GRU增强型APPNP架构传播特征，并构建了精细化多跳视线图以编码车辆间的遮挡关系，从而预测真实阳性和假阴性结果。

Result: MIDAR在nuScenes AD数据集上接近真实的LiDAR检测结果，获得了0.909的AUC，同时验证了其在两个基于合作感知的交通应用中的必要性。

Conclusion: MIDAR模型可以整合到交通模拟器和轨迹数据集中，实际应用表明其在需要准确的个体车辆观测的任务中非常必要。

Abstract: As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has
focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple
AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale
real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most
studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity
raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce
realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV
scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale
efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic
LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from
microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives
(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the
spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop
Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion
relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP
architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to
the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the
detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection
model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further
validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for
tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,
speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be
seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will
be open-sourced upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解各种基于变压器的神经网络在卫星图像处理中的表现，以推动计算机视觉技术的进步。

Method: 使用五种变压器架构和六种卷积网络对三种开源高分辨率遥感图像数据集进行训练和评估，共得到33个深度神经模型。

Result: 论文中比较了11种不同的目标检测和定位算法，证明变压器网络在公开基准数据集上实现了先进水平的性能。

Conclusion: 变压器神经网络在高分辨率卫星图像中的目标检测表现优异，超过传统卷积神经网络。

Abstract: In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as
the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many
domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers,
we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such,
it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks
perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of
performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet
to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper,
we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in
high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data
sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization
algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all
eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is
compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource
high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity.
Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we
then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction
methodologies and detection algorithms.

### [8] [VisuCraft: Enhancing Large Vision-Language Models for Complex Visual-Guided Creative Content Generation via Structured Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02890)
*Rongxin Jiang,Robert Long,Chenghao Gu,Mingrui Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisuCraft 提升了大型视觉语言模型在复杂视觉引导创意文案生成中的表现，尤其在创造力和指令执行方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型在保持高视觉逼真度、创意性和精准执行复杂用户指令生成长文本方面存在局限性。

Method: VisuCraft 通过整合多模态结构化信息抽取器（E）和动态提示生成模块（G）来解决问题。抽取器从输入图像中提取细粒度的视觉属性，转化成丰富的结构化表示，动态提示模块将其与用户指令结合，生成针对 LVLMs 的优化提示。

Result: VisuCraft 在 ImageStoryGen-500K 数据集上进行评估，结果显示在故事生成和诗歌创作等任务中显著优于基线 LVLMs。

Conclusion: VisuCraft 在复杂的视觉引导创造性内容生成中表现出色，特别是在创造力和指令遵循性上。

Abstract: This paper introduces VisuCraft, a novel framework designed to significantly
enhance the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in complex
visual-guided creative content generation. Existing LVLMs often exhibit
limitations in maintaining high visual fidelity, genuine creativity, and
precise adherence to nuanced user instructions when generating long-form texts.
VisuCraft addresses these challenges by integrating a multimodal structured
information extractor (E) and a dynamic prompt generation module (G). The
extractor distills fine-grained visual attributes from input images into a
rich, structured representation, which the dynamic prompt module then combines
with user instructions to create highly optimized prompts for underlying LVLMs
(e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP). Evaluated on the self-constructed
ImageStoryGen-500K dataset using VisuGen Metrics (Visual Grounding, Creativity,
and Instruction Adherence), VisuCraft consistently outperforms baseline LVLMs
across tasks like story generation and poetry composition. Our results
demonstrate remarkable improvements, particularly in creativity and instruction
adherence, validating VisuCraft's effectiveness in producing imaginative,
visually grounded, and user-aligned long-form creative text. This work unlocks
new potential for LVLMs in sophisticated creative AI applications.

### [9] [RDDPM: Robust Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Unsupervised Anomaly Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02903)
*Mehrdad Moradi,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出鲁棒去噪扩散模型，解决无纯正常数据训练的问题，实验结果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在异常分割中取得成功，但通常需要正常数据进行训练，本文提出的方法旨在解决无法接触纯正常数据的问题。

Method: 我们通过将最大似然估计转化为非线性回归问题，重新解释去噪扩散概率模型，并利用鲁棒回归推导出鲁棒版本的去噪扩散概率模型。

Result: 我们的方法在MVTec数据集上取得了最多高出8.08%的AUROC和高出10.37%的AUPRC成绩，证明其优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出了针对仅有混合数据时无监督异常分割的鲁棒去噪扩散模型，实验结果表明其性能优于当前最先进的扩散模型。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success
in unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models
are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an
intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward
diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely
on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them
versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically
assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in
realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion
models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and
anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood
estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the
denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust
regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic
models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust
diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current
state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when
only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing
diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\% higher AUROC and 10.37\%
higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets. The implementation code is available at:

### [10] [How Would It Sound? Material-Controlled Multimodal Acoustic Profile Generation for Indoor Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02905)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于材料配置动态变化时声学环境生成的任务，通过编码器-解码器模型分析视听观察生成室内脉冲响应，展示了其在生成高保真响应中的优越表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成目标声学配置文件以响应用户定义的材料配置对室内场景的声学特性进行控制，旨在满足对不同材料配置下多样化声学环境的需求。

Method: 使用一种新的编码器-解码器方法，该方法从视听观察中编码场景的关键属性，并根据用户提供的材料规格生成目标室内脉冲响应（RIR）。

Result: 通过创造新的基准——Acoustic Wonderland Dataset，并在此基础上进行评估，验证了模型的有效性，结果表明模型在生成高保真的室内脉冲响应方面优于多种基准和先进方法。

Conclusion: 该模型能够有效编码材料信息，生成高保真的室内脉冲响应（RIR），在多个基准和先进方法中表现优异。

Abstract: How would the sound in a studio change with a carpeted floor and acoustic
tiles on the walls? We introduce the task of material-controlled acoustic
profile generation, where, given an indoor scene with specific audio-visual
characteristics, the goal is to generate a target acoustic profile based on a
user-defined material configuration at inference time. We address this task
with a novel encoder-decoder approach that encodes the scene's key properties
from an audio-visual observation and generates the target Room Impulse Response
(RIR) conditioned on the material specifications provided by the user. Our
model enables the generation of diverse RIRs based on various material
configurations defined dynamically at inference time. To support this task, we
create a new benchmark, the Acoustic Wonderland Dataset, designed for
developing and evaluating material-aware RIR prediction methods under diverse
and challenging settings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively encodes material information and generates high-fidelity RIRs,
outperforming several baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

### [11] [Following Route Instructions using Large Vision-Language Models: A Comparison between Low-level and Panoramic Action Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02917)
*Vebjørn Haug Kåsene,Pierre Lison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了开箱即用的LVLMs在视觉和语言导航中的潜力，发现其能够支持导航任务，但表现不如专门设计的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨无需专门设计或优化的开箱即用大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在视觉和语言导航任务中的潜力。

Method: 本文通过微调开源模型Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct，并在Room-to-Room (R2R)数据集上进行评估，以研究开箱即用的LVLMs在不同导航动作空间中的表现。

Result: 微调后的模型在R2R测试集上达到了41%的成功率，表明开箱即用的LVLMs能够学习视觉和语言导航，但其效果仍不如专门设计的导航模型。

Conclusion: 即使无需修改架构或使用模拟器训练，开箱即用的LVLMs也可以支持视觉和语言导航任务，但其表现仍然逊色于专门设计的导航模型。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling
autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural
language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models
specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of
off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used
low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn
left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces
with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether
off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or
simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether
such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this
end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both
low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41%
success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs
can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind
models specifically designed for this task.

### [12] [How Diffusion Prior Landscapes Shape the Posterior in Blind Deconvolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02923)
*Minh-Hai Nguyen,Edouard Pauwels,Pierre Weiss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAP估计在盲解卷积中可能导致模糊解决方案，正确的局部初始化可以解决此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAP估计通常得到双重效果：模糊的图像。

Method: 通过理论分析盲去模糊后验，并采用数值实验验证。

Result: 数值实验验证提供了设计改进的先验和优化技术的实用意义。

Conclusion: MAP估计倾向于产生锐利滤波器和模糊图像解决方案，但通过良好的局部初始化可以在后验中获得逼真的自然图像。

Abstract: The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation is a widely used framework in blind
deconvolution to recover sharp images from blurred observations. The estimated
image and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior
distribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP
estimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its
effectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based
priors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through
an empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two
key properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,
the landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural
images. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
blind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to
produce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.
However local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient
descent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind
deconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations
requires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape.
We validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the
practical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and
optimization techniques.

*Srikanth Muralidharan,Heitor R. Medeiros,Masih Aminbeidokhti,Eric Granger,Marco Pedersoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究表明，对于低于1M参数的小型模型，ImageNet预训练可提高其在红外视觉模态下的对象检测鲁棒性，但效果有容量限制而递减。建议使用预训练，同时避免使用过小型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实际应用需要在有限硬件的小型嵌入设备上运行且具有不同操作条件和模态鲁棒性的识别模型。对于超小型模型，预训练的效果尚不明确，因此需要进行研究。

Method: 通过从标准对象识别架构中导出的缩放法则，构建两个超小型的主干网络系列，并系统地研究它们的性能。

Result: 在三个不同的数据集上的实验表明，ImageNet预训练虽然对小模型有帮助，但在容量超过某个阈值后，效果会递减，尤其是在非分布检测鲁棒性方面。

Conclusion: 研究表明ImageNet预训练对非常小的模型（参数少于1M）在红外视觉模态下进行对象检测的鲁棒性仍然有帮助，但超过某个容量阈值后，其效果会递减。建议使用者尽量避免过小的模型，在不同工作条件下表现不稳定。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require recognition models that are robust to
different operational conditions and modalities, but at the same time run on
small embedded devices, with limited hardware. While for normal size models,
pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for
small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is
not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on
increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M
parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in
the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object
recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and
systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different
datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a
certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of
out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to
still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they
might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working
conditions are different.

Result: X-Actor产生引人入胜的电影风格表演，超越标准的谈话头像动画，在长范围、音频驱动的情感肖像表演中达到目前最优的结果。

Conclusion: X-Actor框架通过抛开视觉和身份提示的紧凑面部运动隐空间，自主回归扩散模型有效捕捉音频和面部动态之间的长期相关性，实现无误差积累的无限长情感丰富的运动预测。

Abstract: We present X-Actor, a novel audio-driven portrait animation framework that
generates lifelike, emotionally expressive talking head videos from a single
reference image and an input audio clip. Unlike prior methods that emphasize
lip synchronization and short-range visual fidelity in constrained speaking
scenarios, X-Actor enables actor-quality, long-form portrait performance
capturing nuanced, dynamically evolving emotions that flow coherently with the
rhythm and content of speech. Central to our approach is a two-stage decoupled
generation pipeline: an audio-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model that
predicts expressive yet identity-agnostic facial motion latent tokens within a
long temporal context window, followed by a diffusion-based video synthesis
module that translates these motions into high-fidelity video animations. By
operating in a compact facial motion latent space decoupled from visual and
identity cues, our autoregressive diffusion model effectively captures
long-range correlations between audio and facial dynamics through a
diffusion-forcing training paradigm, enabling infinite-length emotionally-rich
motion prediction without error accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that X-Actor produces compelling, cinematic-style performances that go beyond
standard talking head animations and achieves state-of-the-art results in
long-range, audio-driven emotional portrait acting.

### [15] [Towards Robust Image Denoising with Scale Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02967)
*Dawei Zhang,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 探讨了尺度等变作为一种核心归纳偏差以改善OOD鲁棒性，提出了一种包含异构归一化模块和交互门控模块的盲去噪框架，证明其在空间异质噪声下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像去噪模型在处理空间变量噪声等分布外条件时难以泛化，存在一个尚未充分探索的泛化差距问题。

Method: 提出了一种鲁棒的盲去噪框架，该框架包含两个关键组件：异构归一化模块（HNM）和交互门控模块（IGM）。HNM用于稳定特征分布并动态校正不同噪声强度下的特征，而IGM通过信号与特征路径之间的门控交互实现有效的信息调制。

Result: 广泛评估表明，该模型在合成和真实基准测试中均持续优于最先进的方法，尤其是在空间异质噪声下。

Conclusion: 将尺度等变结构纳入模型可以改善分布外噪声条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite notable advances in image denoising, existing models often struggle
to generalize beyond in-distribution noise patterns, particularly when
confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions characterized by spatially
variant noise. This generalization gap remains a fundamental yet underexplored
challenge. In this work, we investigate \emph{scale equivariance} as a core
inductive bias for improving OOD robustness. We argue that incorporating
scale-equivariant structures enables models to better adapt from training on
spatially uniform noise to inference on spatially non-uniform degradations.
Building on this insight, we propose a robust blind denoising framework
equipped with two key components: a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM)
and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM). HNM stabilizes feature distributions
and dynamically corrects features under varying noise intensities, while IGM
facilitates effective information modulation via gated interactions between
signal and feature paths. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our model
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and
real-world benchmarks, especially under spatially heterogeneous noise. Code
will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 进一步研究负面提示与无分类器指导之间的关系，以提高扩散模型生成图像对文本描述的遵从度和质量。

Method: 开发了一种名为ANSWER的采样程序，可以同时考虑正负条件，而无需显式负面提示。

Result: 在多个基准测试中加入ANSWER技术的模型在性能上优于基线模型，并且在用户偏好测试中显示出更高的偏好度。

Conclusion: 通过将ANSWER技术添加到现有的扩散模型中，在多个基准测试中表现优于基线，且在人类偏好评估中更受欢迎。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to create
diverse and high-fidelity images from text prompts. However, they are also
well-known to vary substantially regarding both prompt adherence and quality.
Negative prompting was introduced to improve prompt compliance by specifying
what an image must not contain. Previous works have shown the existence of an
ideal negative prompt that can maximize the odds of the positive prompt. In
this work, we explore relations between negative prompting and classifier-free
guidance (CFG) to develop a sampling procedure, {\it Adaptive Negative Sampling
Without External Resources} (ANSWER), that accounts for both positive and
negative conditions from a single prompt. This leverages the internal
understanding of negation by the diffusion model to increase the odds of
generating images faithful to the prompt. ANSWER is a training-free technique,
applicable to any model that supports CFG, and allows for negative grounding of
image concepts without an explicit negative prompts, which are lossy and
incomplete. Experiments show that adding ANSWER to existing DMs outperforms the
baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over the
other methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多域学习架构中，适配器结构对域特定信息的捕捉效果不明确，因此需要一种新的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过将共享和特定领域的LoRA分别置于预训练权重的列和左零子空间中，实现有效的信息捕捉。

Result: 在动作识别任务中使用三个数据集(UCF101, Kinetics400, HMDB51)进行实验，证明该方法在某些情况下是有效的，并分析了LoRA权重的维度问题。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种确保共享和特定领域的LoRA存在于不同子空间的方法，并在动作识别任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Existing architectures of multi-domain learning have two types of adapters:
shared LoRA for all domains and domain-specific LoRA for each particular
domain. However, it remains unclear whether this structure effectively captures
domain-specific information. In this paper, we propose a method that ensures
that shared and domain-specific LoRAs exist in different subspaces;
specifically, the column and left null subspaces of the pre-trained weights. We
apply the proposed method to action recognition with three datasets (UCF101,
Kinetics400, and HMDB51) and demonstrate its effectiveness in some cases along
with the analysis of the dimensions of LoRA weights.

TL;DR: AFOG是一种新型对抗攻击技术，提高了变压器和CNN检测器的攻击效率和隐蔽性，验证结果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性扰动方法在变压器检测器上效果较差，需开发更有效的攻击策略。

Method: 提出一种名为AFOG的注意力集中的进攻梯度攻击，结合学习注意力机制和特征损失更新。

Result: 实验表明，AFOG在大规模检测变压器和CNN检测器上均显著超越现有攻击方法，提升达83%。

Conclusion: AFOG是一种针对目标检测变压器的有效对抗攻击方法，对CNN和变压器检测器都有显著提升。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations are useful tools for exposing vulnerabilities in
neural networks. Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection
are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against
transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive
Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG
is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large
transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a
unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original
contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that
focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,
increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,
AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss
through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial
perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial
perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by
adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which
can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments
conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the
efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms
existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to
83% with superior speed and imperceptibility. Code is available at

*Fan Yang,Yihao Huang,Jiayi Zhu,Ling Shi,Geguang Pu,Jin Song Dong,Kailong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种在生成过程中检测不安全内容的方法，利用预测噪声作为内部信号识别。实验显示该方法在识别NSFW内容方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检测方法主要是生成前过滤提示或生成后审查内容，而生成过程中的检测方法较为缺乏。因此，本文旨在探索在生成阶段检测NSFW内容的方法。

Method: 本文提出了一种简单有效的方法，称为In-Generation Detection (IGD)，在扩散模型的生成过程中，利用预测噪声作为内部信号来识别不安全内容。

Result: 实验表明，IGD在七个NSFW类别上平均检测准确率达到91.32%，超过了七种基准方法。

Conclusion: IGD方法通过捕捉预测噪声中的语义信号，有效识别了生成过程中的NSFW内容并提高检测准确率。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models enable high-quality image
generation but also pose significant risks of misuse, particularly in producing
not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content. While prior detection methods have focused on
filtering prompts before generation or moderating images afterward, the
in-generation phase of diffusion models remains largely unexplored for NSFW
detection. In this paper, we introduce In-Generation Detection (IGD), a simple
yet effective approach that leverages the predicted noise during the diffusion
process as an internal signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is
motivated by preliminary findings suggesting that the predicted noise may
capture semantic cues that differentiate NSFW from benign prompts, even when
the prompts are adversarially crafted. Experiments conducted on seven NSFW
categories show that IGD achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.32% over
naive and adversarial NSFW prompts, outperforming seven baseline methods.

TL;DR: MGFC通过层次化的特征校准增强了VFM在未见域上的鲁棒性，超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数现有的方法集中在全局特征微调上，忽视了跨特征层次的适应，这是精确密集预测所必需的。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的多粒度特征校准框架(MGFC)，执行由粗至细的VFM特征对齐，以增强域转换下的鲁棒性。

Result: MGFC框架在基准数据集上的表现超过了最先进的DGSS方法。

Conclusion: MGFC框架通过层次化和粒度感知的校准方法有效地将VFM的泛化优势转移到DGSS的领域特定任务中，在基准数据集上超越了现有的最先进的DGSS方法

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) aims to improve the
generalization ability of models across unseen domains without access to target
data during training. Recent advances in DGSS have increasingly exploited
vision foundation models (VFMs) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies.
However, most existing approaches concentrate on global feature fine-tuning,
while overlooking hierarchical adaptation across feature levels, which is
crucial for precise dense prediction. In this paper, we propose
Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs
coarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain
shifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture
global contextual semantics and scene-level structure. Then, it refines
medium-grained features by promoting category-level feature discriminability.
Finally, fine-grained features are calibrated through high-frequency spatial
detail enhancement. By performing hierarchical and granularity-aware
calibration, MGFC effectively transfers the generalization strengths of VFMs to
the domain-specific task of DGSS. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS approaches,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-granularity adaptation for the semantic
segmentation task of domain generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态大模型在长视频理解上表现较差，因为资源限制使得它们无法处理所有的视频帧及其相关信息。需要高效提取相关信息来提高模型性能。

Method: 提出了一种新的视频问答任务场景，称为SceneQA，强调基于场景的细节感知和推理能力。此外，开发了LVSQA数据集，并提出了一种新方法SLFG，该方法结合了场景定位和动态帧重组机制，将单个帧合成为语义连贯的场景帧，显著增强长视频理解能力，而无需修改原始模型架构。

Result: 实验结果显示，SLFG方法在多个长视频基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: 提出的SLFG方法可以显著提升现有多模态大模型在长视频中的理解能力，并具有出色的即插即用性。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long
video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them
from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently
extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks
and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core
objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the
practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a
new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes
scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA
dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected
videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to
promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long
videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG.
The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically
coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic
frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding
capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to
the original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability.
Experimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in
several long video benchmark tests. Code and dataset will be released at
http://www.slfg.pkuzwh.cn.

*Liheng Zhang,Weihao Yu,Zubo Lu,Haozhi Gu,Jin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了SA-3DGS，以解决3D高斯合成的大存储需求和渲染性能限制问题，其通过剪枝和压缩技术显著减少存储成本，并在多个基准测试中保持或改进了渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯点方法在压缩时难以识别场景中真正无关紧要的高斯点，导致随后高斯剪枝和压缩质量下降，以及渲染性能受限。

Method: SA-3DGS通过学习重要性得分来自动识别场景重建中最不重要的高斯点，从而实现有效的剪枝和冗余减少。随后，重要性感知聚类模块更准确地将高斯属性压缩到码本中，提升了码本的表达能力并减少模型尺寸。最终，码本修复模块利用上下文场景信息修复码本，从而恢复原始高斯点属性并减轻信息损失导致的渲染质量下降。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个基准数据集上实现了高达66倍的压缩，同时保持或甚至提高了渲染质量。高斯剪枝方法不仅能适应，还能改进其他剪枝方法（如LightGaussian），展现了出色的性能和强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SA-3DGS方法能够在大幅度减小存储成本的同时，维持渲染质量甚至提升。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have enhanced efficient and
high-quality novel view synthesis. However, representing scenes requires a
large number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting
practical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian
models but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the
scene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression
quality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS,
a method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering
quality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least
significant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective
pruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module
compresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving
the codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the
codebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the
codebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and
mitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method
achieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering
quality. The proposed Gaussian pruning approach is not only adaptable to but
also improves other pruning-based methods (e.g., LightGaussian), showcasing
excellent performance and strong generalization ability.

Result: MoCA在CelebIPVid数据集上的实验表明，与现有T2V方法相比，其在人脸相似度方面的性能提高超过5%。

Conclusion: MoCA提高了多帧身份一致性并捕捉面部动态细节，超越现有文本到视频生成方法。

Abstract: Achieving ID-preserving text-to-video (T2V) generation remains challenging
despite recent advances in diffusion-based models. Existing approaches often
fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity
coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video
Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating
a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts
paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding
MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures
identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention
Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate
a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained
details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a
dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals,
promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid
show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face

Abstract: Cross-video question answering presents significant challenges beyond
traditional single-video understanding, particularly in establishing meaningful
connections across video streams and managing the complexity of multi-source
information retrieval. We introduce VideoForest, a novel framework that
addresses these challenges through person-anchored hierarchical reasoning. Our
approach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between
videos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring
end-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a
human-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking
algorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple
video sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that
hierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and
3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this
hierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our
approach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset
specifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental
results demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning
tasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior
analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly
outperforming existing methods. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-video understanding by unifying multiple video streams through
person-level features, enabling sophisticated reasoning across distributed
visual information while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Existing studies on talking video generation have predominantly focused on
single-person monologues or isolated facial animations, limiting their
applicability to realistic multi-human interactions. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MIT, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for multi-human
talking video generation. To this end, we develop an automatic pipeline that
collects and annotates multi-person conversational videos. The resulting
dataset comprises 12 hours of high-resolution footage, each featuring two to

To demonstrate the potential of MIT, we furthur propose CovOG, a baseline model
for this novel task. It integrates a Multi-Human Pose Encoder (MPE) to handle
varying numbers of speakers by aggregating individual pose embeddings, and an
Interactive Audio Driver (IAD) to modulate head dynamics based on
speaker-specific audio features. Together, these components showcase the
feasibility and challenges of generating realistic multi-human talking videos,
establishing MIT as a valuable benchmark for future research. The code is

TL;DR: 引入了无需修剪图的FaceMat框架，通过双阶段训练提高了人脸滤镜在遮挡情况下的性能，并在多个测试中超越了现有的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人脸滤镜在遮挡情况下性能下降的问题，引入人脸抠图任务以估计精细的alpha mattes，将遮挡元素与面部区域分离开来。

Method: 采用无需修剪图的框架，并使用两阶段训练管道。教师模型利用负对数似然损失来共同估计alpha mattes和每像素不确定性，随后不确定性用于指导学生模型通过空间自适应知识蒸馏。这使得学生能够集中于模糊或遮挡的区域，提高了泛化能力并保持了语义一致性。

Result: FaceMat框架在真实世界的短视频应用中提高了人脸滤镜的视觉效果和鲁棒性，并在多个基准测试中超越了现有方法。构建了CelebAMat大规模合成数据集，用于支持遮挡感知的人脸抠图任务。

Conclusion: FaceMat在多个基准上表现优于最前沿的方法，增强了人脸滤镜在真实世界中的视觉质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling
a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However,
their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects
like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,
we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha
mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present
FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality
alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage
training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes
and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this
uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive
knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on
ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic
consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation
masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for
real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by
explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling
clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed
CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for
occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the
visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained
video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at

which dilutes the distinctive strengths of each modality and destroys their
inherent complementarity. To achieve cooperative harmonization rather than
homogenization, we propose CHARM, a novel complementary learning framework
designed to implicitly align content while preserving modality-specific
advantages through two components: (1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU), enabling
implicit alignment through window-based cross-modal interaction, where
modalities serve as both queries and contexts for each other to discover
modality-interactive correspondences; (2) A dual-path optimization strategy
that decouples training into Collaborative Learning Strategy (CoL) for
complementary fusion learning and Individual Enhancement Strategy (InE) for
protected modality-specific optimization. Experiments across multiple datasets
and backbones indicate that CHARM consistently outperform the baselines, with
significant increment on the fragile modalities. This work shifts the focus
from model homogenization to harmonization, enabling cross-modal
complementarity for true harmony in diversity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决行人重识别中的无监督域适应问题，通过生成多样化数据和融合特征提高模型性能。

Method: 引入了CycleGAN用于预训练阶段的数据生成，在微调阶段通过教师-学生网络整合多视角特征并进行多层次聚类生成多样化的伪标签，并利用可学习的集成融合组件提升学习完整性。

Conclusion: CORE-ReID框架通过融合精细的局部信息和全局特征，显著提高了无监督域适应下的行人重识别性能。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework, "Comprehensive Optimization and
Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person
Re-identification (CORE-ReID)", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to
generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from
different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage,
based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates
multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels.
A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local
information within global features is introduced to enhance learning
comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels.
Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate
significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional
enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean
Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global
and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the
framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids
ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision,
Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution
for the UDA in Person ReID. Our codes and models are available at

TL;DR: SSFMamba通过融合空间和频率特征，实现了3D医学图像分割性能的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统空间域方法在3D医学图像分割方面对全局上下文建模的能力有限，需要引入频率域来增强全局信息建模能力。

Method: 提出SSFMamba网络，采用双分支架构分别从空间和频率域提取特征，并通过Mamba块融合这些异构特征。

Result: 在BraTS2020和BraTS2023数据集上的实验表明，SSFMamba在各种评估指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出了基于Mamba的空间-频率特征融合网络SSFMamba，在3D医学图像分割方面优于当前的先进方法。

Abstract: In light of the spatial domain's limited capacity for modeling global context
in 3D medical image segmentation, emerging approaches have begun to incorporate
frequency domain representations. However, straightforward feature extraction
strategies often overlook the unique properties of frequency domain
information, such as conjugate symmetry. They also fail to account for the
fundamental differences in data distribution between the spatial and frequency
domains, which can ultimately dilute or obscure the complementary strengths
that frequency-based representations offer. In this paper, we propose SSFMamba,
a Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D
medical image segmentation. SSFMamba employs a complementary dual-branch
architecture that extracts features from both the spatial and frequency
domains, and leverages a Mamba block to fuse these heterogeneous features to
preserve global context while reinforcing local details. In the frequency
domain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global
contextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency
domain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D
multi-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and
global cues. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 提出一种增强3D重建质量的模块RobustGS，可以在插件形式下集成到现有方法中，提升鲁棒性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的前馈方法通常假设输入的多视图图像是干净且高质量的，但在现实世界中经常遇到噪声、低光或雨天等挑战条件，导致几何不准确和3D重建质量降低。

Method: 我们引入了一个通用降解学习器和一个语义感知状态空间模型，通过增强多视图输入的降解表示和语义相似信息的聚合来提高重建质量。

Result: 我们的方法以插件形式集成到现有方法中时，在各种降解类型下持续实现了最先进的重建质量。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一种名为RobustGS的模块，可以增强前馈3D高斯点检测方法在各种不利成像条件下的鲁棒性，从而实现高质量的3D重建。

Abstract: Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes the limitations of
optimization-based 3DGS by enabling fast and high-quality reconstruction
without the need for per-scene optimization. However, existing feedforward
approaches typically assume that input multi-view images are clean and
high-quality. In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under
challenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in
inaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement
module, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward
3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D
reconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing
pretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction
robustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized
Degradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and
distributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby
enhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D
reconstruction. In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space
model. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance
corrupted inputs in the feature space. Then, it employs a semantic-aware
strategy to aggregate semantically similar information across different views,
enabling the extraction of fine-grained cross-view correspondences and further
improving the quality of 3D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach, when integrated into existing methods in a plug-and-play
manner, consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across
various types of degradations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs的广泛应用引发了对其公平性尤其是在更多属性上的关注，现有研究多集中于种族、性别等人口统计属性，但其他属性方面的公平性仍需探索。

Method: 构建一个开集的偏见属性知识库，并利用LLMs评估LVLMs在更细粒度属性上的公平性。

Result: 实验结果显示，LVLMs在多种细粒度属性上表现出偏见，这些偏见更受文化、环境和行为因素的影响。

Conclusion: 研究表明，LVLMs在涉及文化、环境、行为等多种属性方面存在偏见，其影响比传统人口统计属性更为显著。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of applications using Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, has raised significant concerns about their fairness.
While existing studies primarily focus on demographic attributes such as race
and gender, fairness across a broader range of attributes remains largely
unexplored. In this study, we construct an open-set knowledge base of bias
attributes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the fairness of
LVLMs across finer-grained attributes. Our experimental results reveal that
LVLMs exhibit biased outputs across a diverse set of attributes and further
demonstrate that cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors have a more
pronounced impact on LVLM decision-making than traditional demographic
attributes.

Method: 提出了一种名为Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$)的对比增强方法，以及一个袋级和组级对比学习框架。

Result: 通过引入新的实例和增强特征的判别能力，模型性能得到改善，尤其在测试包含小肿瘤区域的幻灯片时。实验结果证明该方法在多个评估指标上超过了先进的方法。

Conclusion: $C^2Aug$方法显著提高了模型性能，尤其在多种评估指标上都优于现有的方法。

Abstract: Recent pseudo-bag augmentation methods for Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL)-based Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification sample instances from a
limited number of bags, resulting in constrained diversity. To address this
issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample
instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of
pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases
the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results
in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances,
thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small
tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level
contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with
distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在利用文本模态信息进行持续学习时，仅依赖简单模板，忽略了丰富的语义信息，因此需要一种方法来更好地集成这些信息，提高图像分类性能。

Method: 框架动态构建视觉概念池，通过相似性过滤机制防止冗余，并采用跨模态图像概念注意模块和注意损失，将概念整合到持续学习过程中。

Result: 实验表明，本文方法在医疗和自然图像数据集上达到了最先进的性能，证明了其效果和优越性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖框架，将大语言模型生成的视觉概念作为判别性语义指导，为医疗图像分类系统的持续学习提供支持，并显著提高了性能。

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for medical image classification systems to
adapt to dynamically evolving clinical environments. The integration of
multimodal information can significantly enhance continual learning of image
classes. However, while existing approaches do utilize textual modality
information, they solely rely on simplistic templates with a class name,
thereby neglecting richer semantic information. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large
language models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance. Our method
dynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering
mechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the
continual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention
module, coupled with an attention loss. Through attention, the module can
leverage the semantic knowledge from relevant visual concepts and produce
class-representative fused features for classification. Experiments on medical
and natural image datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We
will release the code publicly.

Method: AVATAR使用一种非策略训练架构提高样本效率，并采用时间优势塑造策略在学习过程中着重突出关键推理步骤。

Result: AVATAR在MMVU、OmniBench和Video-Holmes基准测试中分别超过了Qwen2.5-Omni基线+5.4、+4.9和+4.5，并显示出超过35%的样本效率提升。

Conclusion: AVATAR框架在多模态长时段视频推理任务中表现优异，解决了现有方法中的数据低效、优势消失和统一信贷分配问题，通过提高样本效率和优化信贷分配策略，超过了多个基准测试中的现有基线。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video is challenging due to the need
for precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities. While recent
methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in
this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from
their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or
near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by
producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails
to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce AVATAR (Audio-Video Agent
for Alignment and Reasoning), a framework that addresses these limitations
through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that
improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past
experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping
(TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases
during learning. AVATAR achieves strong performance across various benchmarks,
outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by +5.4on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and
+4.5 on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating over 35% higher sample efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架CCA，以提升FSL性能，通过显式解开视觉特征并利用CLIP的跨模态对齐，减少过拟合并增强分类准确率。实验显示其超越了现有最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过解开视觉特征来减少需要学习的参数数量，以减少过拟合，并且利用CLIP的多模态对比学习方法进行潜在表征解耦，提升FSL中的模型适应性。

Method: 提出了一种称为Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA)的新框架，利用无监督的独立成分分析（ICA）来显式解开CLIP中提取的视觉特征，并结合了CLIP固有的跨模态对齐机制，其中包括单向微调CLIP文本分类器和双向跨注意力机制。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上，CCA算法在保持计算效率的同时，一致性地超越了最先进的方法，在few-shot性能和对分布转变的鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: CCA显著提升了FSL的性能和对分布转变的鲁棒性，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using
limited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled
representations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process
to obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which
hinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal
contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent
representations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the
Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles
visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component
Analysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the
labeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and
mitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual
disentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal
alignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent
cross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through
fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a
cross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations
through mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification
outputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Code will be available at

Motivation: 现有的3D重建方法面临着显式方法的几何精确性与隐式方法的收敛速度之间的权衡。

Method: H3R框架由两个互补组件组成：一个通过对极约束强制几何一致性的高效潜在体积，以及一个使用Plücker坐标进行自适应对应精细化的相机感知Transformer。

Result: 该方法在RealEstate10K、ACID和DTU数据集上的PSNR分别提升了0.59 dB、1.06 dB和0.22 dB，并展现了跨数据集的泛化能力。

Conclusion: H3R提出了一种混合框架，通过结合体素潜在融合和基于注意力的特征聚合，解决了3D重建中的几何精确性和歧义区域问题。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting, generalizable
3D reconstruction remains challenging, particularly in multi-view
correspondence modeling. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
explicit methods achieve geometric precision but struggle with ambiguous
regions, while implicit methods provide robustness but suffer from slow
convergence. We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation
by integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature
aggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an
efficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar
constraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\"ucker
coordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement. By integrating both
paradigms, our approach enhances generalization while converging 2$\times$
faster than existing methods. Furthermore, we show that spatial-aligned
foundation models (e.g., SD-VAE) substantially outperform semantic-aligned
models (e.g., DINOv2), resolving the mismatch between semantic representations
and spatial reconstruction requirements. Our method supports variable-number
and high-resolution input views while demonstrating robust cross-dataset
generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with significant PSNR
improvements of 0.59 dB, 1.06 dB, and 0.22 dB on the RealEstate10K, ACID, and

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with
satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert
workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale
automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term,
high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking
low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are
essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap
with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter
resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over
Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components:
Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA,
comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across
eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped
pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human
verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark
reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The
open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in
captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current
approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on
Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and
boosts VQA accuracy from \textbf{0.74} to 0.87. Code and data are available at

Abstract: The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical
challenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the
shape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to
find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,
such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,
whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost
of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on
space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods
are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of
interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to
large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the
real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state
estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a
chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast
FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed
to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking
sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours
to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to
the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an
attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly
trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The
resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than
classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other
state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on
renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.

Abstract: Fire scene datasets are crucial for training robust computer vision models,
particularly in tasks such as fire early warning and emergency rescue
operations. However, among the currently available fire-related data, there is
a significant shortage of annotated data specifically targeting building
units.To tackle this issue, we introduce an annotated dataset of building units
captured by drones, which incorporates multiple enhancement techniques. We
construct backgrounds using real multi-story scenes, combine motion blur and
brightness adjustment to enhance the authenticity of the captured images,
simulate drone shooting conditions under various circumstances, and employ
large models to generate fire effects at different locations.The synthetic
dataset generated by this method encompasses a wide range of building
scenarios, with a total of 1,978 images. This dataset can effectively improve
the generalization ability of fire unit detection, providing multi-scenario and
scalable data while reducing the risks and costs associated with collecting
real fire data. The dataset is available at

Abstract: In recent years, unified vision-language models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced,
effectively tackling both visual understanding and generation tasks within a
single design. While many unified VLMs have explored various design choices,
the recent hypothesis from OpenAI's GPT-4o suggests a promising generation
pipeline: Understanding VLM->Visual Feature->Projector->Diffusion Model->Image.
The understanding VLM is frozen, and only the generation-related modules are
trained. This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM
while enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this
pipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of
unified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored.
In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to
enable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps:
understanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the
source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and
makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing
instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing
for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3.
The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the
intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective
feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop.
This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence,
delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our
method based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SARD的新框架，提高了工业异常检测系统的鲁棒性，具备更好的分割精度和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近的扩散方法在建模复杂缺陷模式方面表现出强大的能力，但在空间可控性上存在困难，并且未能保持细粒度的区域保真度。

Method: 提出了SARD，一种新颖的基于扩散的框架，通过区域约束的扩散和判别掩模指导进行异常生成。区域约束扩散通过冻结背景并在反向去噪阶段有选择地只更新前景异常区域来保留背景，从而有效减少背景伪影。判别掩模指导模块使鉴别器能够在像素级掩模指导下对全球现实性和局部异常保真度进行联合评估。

Conclusion: SARD在分割精度和视觉质量方面均超越了现有方法，为像素级异常合成设定了新的最先进状态。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic and spatially precise anomalies is essential for
enhancing the robustness of industrial anomaly detection systems. While recent
diffusion-based methods have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling
complex defect patterns, they often struggle with spatial controllability and
fail to maintain fine-grained regional fidelity. To overcome these limitations,
we propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware anomaly synthesis via Region-constrained
Diffusion with discriminative mask Guidance), a novel diffusion-based framework
specifically designed for anomaly generation. Our approach introduces a
Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process that preserves the background by
freezing it and selectively updating only the foreground anomaly regions during
the reverse denoising phase, thereby effectively reducing background artifacts.
Additionally, we incorporate a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module into
the discriminator, enabling joint evaluation of both global realism and local
anomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in
segmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for
pixel-level anomaly synthesis.

TL;DR: 本文提出LORE方法，解决了现有方法在图像编辑中的泛化性和可控性问题，无需训练或模型调整，实验显示其在语义对齐和图像质量方面优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于反演的编辑方法存在结构性缺陷，即反转噪声中编码的源概念的语义偏向抑制了对目标概念的注意，特别是在源语义和目标语义不相似时，该问题导致编辑失败或非目标区域的非预期修改。

Method: 提出了一种无需训练、高效的图像编辑方法LORE，该方法直接优化反演噪声，无需修改架构或微调模型。

Result: LORE在三个具有挑战性的基准（PIEBench、SmartEdit和GapEdit）上的实验结果表明，其在语义对齐、图像质量和背景保真度方面显著优于强基线。

Conclusion: LORE显著优于强基线，在语义对齐、图像质量和背景保真度方面表现出色，展示了潜在空间优化在通用图像编辑中的有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Text-driven image editing enables users to flexibly modify visual content
through natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as
semantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent
inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved
promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in
their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in
the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This
issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are
dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure
or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we
systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a
training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the
inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and
controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and
general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural
modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on
three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit. Experimental
results show that LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of
semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, demonstrating the
effectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose
image editing.

Motivation: 现有的实际图表数据集存在包含无法从图表推断的无关信息的问题，且未能充分捕捉结构元素和关键见解。因此，引入ChartCap数据集以解决这些问题。

Method: 设计了一个四阶段流程，使用图表的可辨认数据生成描述，并采用基于循环一致性的人类验证方法进行质量控制。此外，提出了视觉一致性评分这一新的指标来评估描述质量。

Result: 在ChartCap数据集上微调的模型生成的图表描述更准确、信息丰富且幻觉减少，超越了开源、专有模型和人工标注的图表描述。

Conclusion: 利用ChartCap数据集进行微调的模型可以生成更准确、信息丰富且减少幻觉的图表描述，性能超越了开源和专有模型以及人工标注的图表描述。

Abstract: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts
remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of
large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing
real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information
that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture
structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a
large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific,
dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both
structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a
four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data
from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which
accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption
quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a
caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive
experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate
more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing
both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

TL;DR: 研究提出SAVER机制，通过数据集对比分析和实验，显著缓解风格化图像中LVLMs的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然之前的方法有效减少了摄影图像中的幻觉，但它们忽略了由风格化图像带来的潜在风险，这些图像在游戏场景理解、艺术教育和医学分析等重要领域中发挥着关键作用。

Method: 提出了一种名为SAVER的机制，通过在早期层次的反馈来动态调整LVLMs的最终输出，从而减轻由风格化图像引起的幻觉。

Result: 实验显示SAVER在幻觉缓解方面效果显著，对比13种先进LVLMs表现出色。

Conclusion: SAVER在不同模型、数据集和任务上的幻觉缓解方面达到了最新技术水平。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) recently achieve significant
breakthroughs in understanding complex visual-textual contexts. However,
hallucination issues still limit their real-world applicability. Although
previous mitigation methods effectively reduce hallucinations in photographic
images, they largely overlook the potential risks posed by stylized images,
which play crucial roles in critical scenarios such as game scene
understanding, art education, and medical analysis. In this work, we first
construct a dataset comprising photographic images and their corresponding
stylized versions with carefully annotated caption labels. We then conduct
head-to-head comparisons on both discriminative and generative tasks by
benchmarking 13 advanced LVLMs on the collected datasets. Our findings reveal
that stylized images tend to induce significantly more hallucinations than
their photographic counterparts. To address this issue, we propose Style-Aware
Visual Early Revision SAVER, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts LVLMs'
final outputs based on the token-level visual attention patterns, leveraging
early-layer feedback to mitigate hallucinations caused by stylized images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAVER achieves state-of-the-art
performance in hallucination mitigation across various models, datasets, and
tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效的双层次3D高斯喷涂框架，通过引入单元代理和加权求和技术，显著减少了计算开销并提高了渲染效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯喷涂方法中的顺序alpha混合操作计算开销大，尤其是在资源受限的平台上导致显著的开销。为了提高渲染效率，我们提出一个新的框架来解决这个问题。

Method: 我们提出了一种双层次框架，结合了代理高斯表示和顺序无关的渲染技术。为了减少由视图自适应基数排序造成的开销，我们引入了用于局部高斯管理的单元代理，并提出了单元搜索光栅化以进一步加速。然后，我们结合顺序无关透明度技术，开发了一种物理启发的加权求和渲染技术。

Result: 提出的Duplex-GS框架不但保持了实时性能，还成功地消除了“弹出”和“透明”伪影，显著提高了精度和效率。该技术在真实世界数据集上表现出色，实现了显著的速度提升和开销减少。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在多尺度训练视图和大规模环境中表现出了强大的鲁棒性，并且在各种真实世界数据集上的实验结果验证了OIT渲染模式在高斯喷涂中的优势。我们的技术在不牺牲质量的情况下，实现了比现有OIT基础高斯喷涂方法高1.5到4倍的速度加快，并减少了52.2%到86.9%的基数排序开销。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
rendering fidelity and efficiency. However, these methods still rely on
computationally expensive sequential alpha-blending operations, resulting in
significant overhead, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. In this
paper, we propose Duplex-GS, a dual-hierarchy framework that integrates proxy
Gaussian representations with order-independent rendering techniques to achieve
photorealistic results while sustaining real-time performance. To mitigate the
overhead caused by view-adaptive radix sort, we introduce cell proxies for
local Gaussians management and propose cell search rasterization for further
acceleration. By seamlessly combining our framework with Order-Independent
Transparency (OIT), we develop a physically inspired weighted sum rendering
technique that simultaneously eliminates "popping" and "transparency"
artifacts, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.
Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the
robustness of our method across diverse scenarios, including multi-scale
training views and large-scale environments. Our results validate the
advantages of the OIT rendering paradigm in Gaussian Splatting, achieving
high-quality rendering with an impressive 1.5 to 4 speedup over existing OIT
based Gaussian Splatting approaches and 52.2% to 86.9% reduction of the radix
sort overhead without quality degradation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的深度估计方法，通过GLKAM和GBPM模块提高估计准确性，在多个数据集上证明优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目深度估计存在固有的模糊性，这是因为从单一视角恢复三维结构的性质不明确，多种可能的深度配置可以产生相同的二维投影。

Method: 提出了一种结合局部与全局线索的深度估计方法，通过大核卷积与门控机制捕获多尺度局部结构信息的Gated Large Kernel Attention Module (GLKAM)，以及估计深度分布的Global Bin Prediction Module (GBPM)。

Result: 在NYU-V2和KITTI数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法表现良好，超越了现有方法，验证了所提组件的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提方法结合局部与全局线索提高了深度估计的准确性，其中GLKAM与GBPM模块有效增强了网络的多尺度局部结构捕获与全局感知能力。

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation remains a challenging problem due to the
inherent ambiguity that stems from the ill-posed nature of recovering 3D
structure from a single view, where multiple plausible depth configurations can
produce identical 2D projections. In this paper, we present a novel depth
estimation method that combines both local and global cues to improve
prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose the Gated Large Kernel Attention
Module (GLKAM) to effectively capture multi-scale local structural information
by leveraging large kernel convolutions with a gated mechanism. To further
enhance the global perception of the network, we introduce the Global Bin
Prediction Module (GBPM), which estimates the global distribution of depth bins
and provides structural guidance for depth regression. Extensive experiments on
the NYU-V2 and KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance and outperforms existing approaches, validating the effectiveness
of each proposed component.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部伪造技术的快速发展要求检测器能够持续适应新伪造方法，然而，检测器在学习新伪造类型时常常会快速退化为忆旧类型，即灾难性遗忘现象。

Method: 提出了基于Kolmogorov-Arnold网络的连续面部伪造检测框架（KAN-CFD），包括域组KAN检测器（DG-KD）和数据无关重放特征分离策略通过KAN漂移补偿投影（FS-KDCP）。

Result: 所提出的方法在实验中显示了优越的性能，并且在减少遗忘方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，该方法实现了出色的性能，并显著减少了遗忘现象。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors
continuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery
detection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn
new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly,
a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling
them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while
leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for
addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant
limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional
images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images
lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when
features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to
distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the
same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery
Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector
(DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift
Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional
image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the
overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
performance while notably reducing forgetting.

Motivation: 由于CNV形状不规则以及成像限制，如投射伪影、噪声和边界模糊，现有的CNV分割任务面临挑战。此外，缺乏公开数据集限制了CNV分析。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的多任务图卷积交互增强CNV分割网络（MTG-Net），通过多任务框架和两个图基跨任务模块（MIGR和MRGR）进行分割。

Result: MTG-Net实现区域分割的Dice评分为87.21%，血管分割为88.12%。实验表明MTG-Net优于现有的方法。

Conclusion: MTG-Net网络在湿性年龄相关性黄斑变性（wet AMD）的光学相干断层扫描血管造影（OCTA）图像上的脉络膜新生血管（CNV）分割任务中表现优异，超过了现有方法。

Abstract: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a primary characteristic of wet
age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), represents a leading cause of
blindness worldwide. In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography
angiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological
changes, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,
accurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for
clinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular
CNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and
boundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets
constraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper
constructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a
novel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation
network (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological
information, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the
graph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two
graph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)
and Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework
encodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the
image into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason
about higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism,
enabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally,
an uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts
and noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that
MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21\% for
region segmentation and 88.12\% for vessel segmentation.

Conclusion: AlignCAT在三个视觉定位基准测试上表现优越，证明了其在解决视觉文本语义细微差异方面的有效性。

Abstract: Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images
based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack
strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text
expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address
these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching
framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we
propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information
and global context, effectively mitigating interference from
category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module
leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to
achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest
extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual
queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on
three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the
superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG
tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/AlignCAT.

Result: INP-CC模型在SWIG-HOI和HICO-DET数据集上显著优于目前最先进的模型。

Conclusion: INP-CC模型通过改进交互检测提示生成和概念校准，提升了开放词汇人-对象交互检测的性能。

Abstract: Open Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to detect
interactions between humans and objects while generalizing to novel interaction
classes beyond the training set. Current methods often rely on Vision and
Language Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as
image-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level
interaction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding
textual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the
model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues,
we propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an
end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware
prompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware
prompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on
the input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This
approach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than
generic image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine
HOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which
helps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities
across categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve
inter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate
visually similar but semantically distinct actions. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that INP-CC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
models on the SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models能够通过共享的图片推断出用户位置，对地理隐私构成威胁。现有的对抗性方法在高分辨率图像和低扰动预算情况下表现不佳。

Method: 提出GeoShield对抗性框架，包括三个关键模块：特征解耦模块、曝光元素识别模块和尺度自适应增强模块。

Result: GeoShield在挑战性基准测试中表现出色，提供强大的隐私保护，同时对视觉或语义质量影响很小。

Conclusion: GeoShield在真实场景中的地理隐私保护方面表现出色，超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable
ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a
substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a
potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often
perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may
introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose
GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy
protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a
feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical
information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints
geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module
that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure
effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in
black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on
visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore
adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by
advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating
privacy concerns.

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models.
Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of
high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data
augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield
limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore,
developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly
robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic
analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among
diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing
robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial
Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature
and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation
process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation
offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial
perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results
demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for
data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the
online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework
provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code

Result: 提出的ActionSink框架在机器人操控任务中能够显著提高动作估计的精度，尤其是在LIBERO基准和LIBERO-Long任务中实现了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: ActionSink框架在LIBERO基准测试中比以前的SOTA提高了7.9%的成功率，并在具有挑战性的长周期视觉任务LIBERO-Long中获得了近8%的准确性提升。

Abstract: Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due
to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in
high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress
of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action
estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.
To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,
ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of
learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink
reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,
called "action flow", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be
retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,
ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a
coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of
action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is
a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that
dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be
used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a
multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action
flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate
action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our
ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\%
success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging
long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，我们的方法能够提取干净的3D资源，并在在线（例如自提示）和离线（例如对比提升）设置中一致地改善3D分割。

Abstract: We address the challenge of lifting 2D visual segmentation to 3D in Gaussian
Splatting. Existing methods often suffer from inconsistent 2D masks across
viewpoints and produce noisy segmentation boundaries as they neglect these
semantic cues to refine the learned Gaussians. To overcome this, we introduce
Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), which augments the standard Gaussian
representation with an instance weight matrix across input views. Leveraging
the inherent consistency of Gaussians in 3D, we use this matrix to identify and
correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. Furthermore, since each Gaussian
ideally corresponds to a single object, we propose a GIT-guided adaptive
density control mechanism to split and prune ambiguous Gaussians during
training, resulting in sharper and more coherent 2D and 3D segmentation
boundaries. Experimental results show that our method extracts clean 3D assets
and consistently improves 3D segmentation in both online (e.g., self-prompting)
and offline (e.g., contrastive lifting) settings, enabling applications such as
hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient characterization of nanoparticle morphology in
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images is critical for ensuring product
quality in nanomaterial synthesis and accelerating development. However,
conventional deep learning methods for shape classification require extensive
labeled datasets and computationally demanding training, limiting their
accessibility to the typical nanoparticle practitioner in research and
industrial settings. In this study, we introduce a zero-shot classification
pipeline that leverages two vision foundation models: the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for object segmentation and DINOv2 for feature embedding. By
combining these models with a lightweight classifier, we achieve high-precision
shape classification across three morphologically diverse nanoparticle datasets
- without the need for extensive parameter fine-tuning. Our methodology
outperforms a fine-tuned YOLOv11 and ChatGPT o4-mini-high baselines,
demonstrating robustness to small datasets, subtle morphological variations,
and domain shifts from natural to scientific imaging. Quantitative clustering
metrics on PCA plots of the DINOv2 features are discussed as a means of
assessing the progress of the chemical synthesis. This work highlights the
potential of foundation models to advance automated microscopy image analysis,
offering an alternative to traditional deep learning pipelines in nanoparticle
research which is both more efficient and more accessible to the user.

TL;DR: FFHQ-Makeup 是首个高质量成对裸妆面部图像数据集，提供多样化妆风格并保留身份与表情一致性，满足美容领域的研究需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成对的裸妆面部图像对于许多美容相关任务至关重要，但收集高质量化妆数据集仍然是一个重大挑战。现有的合成方法在现实感或裸妆图像一致性方面存在不足。

Method: 提出了一种改进的化妆迁移方法，能够解耦身份和化妆样式，将真实世界的化妆样式转移到18,000个身份上。每个身份与5种不同的化妆样式配对，形成总共90,000对高质量裸妆图像对。

Result: 创建了一个名为FFHQ-Makeup的高质量合成化妆数据集，该数据集在保留面部身份和表情一致性的同时，为每个身份配对了多种化妆样式。

Conclusion: FFHQ-Makeup 数据集弥补了高质量裸妆对数据集的空缺，并为未来美容相关任务的研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Paired bare-makeup facial images are essential for a wide range of
beauty-related tasks, such as virtual try-on, facial privacy protection, and
facial aesthetics analysis. However, collecting high-quality paired makeup
datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is
constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while
existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or
inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods
typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often
distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and
text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression,
undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality
synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles
while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon
the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from
existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup
transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired
with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality
bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that
FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets
and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.

TL;DR: MVTOP是一种新型变压器方法，可以通过多视图特征融合来解决姿态模糊问题，表现优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单视图无法解决的姿态模糊问题，以提升多视图对象姿态估计的准确性。

Method: 使用基于变压器的方法，MVTOP通过视图特定特征的早期融合来处理多视图几何，利用来自相机中心的视线来预测姿态。该方法是端到端可训练的，不需要额外的数据输入。

Result: MVTOP在合成数据集上性能超越其他方法，并且在YCB-V数据集上取得竞争性结果。

Conclusion: MVTOP能够有效地解决多视图下的姿态模糊问题，并在特定数据集上表现优于其他单视图和现有多视图方法。

Abstract: We present MVTOP, a novel transformer-based method for multi-view rigid
object pose estimation. Through an early fusion of the view-specific features,
our method can resolve pose ambiguities that would be impossible to solve with
a single view or with a post-processing of single-view poses. MVTOP models the
multi-view geometry via lines of sight that emanate from the respective camera
centers. While the method assumes the camera interior and relative orientations
are known for a particular scene, they can vary for each inference. This makes
the method versatile. The use of the lines of sight enables MVTOP to correctly
predict the correct pose with the merged multi-view information. To show the
model's capabilities, we provide a synthetic data set that can only be solved
with such holistic multi-view approaches since the poses in the dataset cannot
be solved with just one view. Our method outperforms single-view and all
existing multi-view approaches on our dataset and achieves competitive results
on the YCB-V dataset. To the best of our knowledge, no holistic multi-view
method exists that can resolve such pose ambiguities reliably. Our model is
end-to-end trainable and does not require any additional data, e.g., depth.

Conclusion: 我们的轻量级设计使得该模块能够嵌入到事件相机中或用作下游视觉任务的高效前端预处理。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages such as high temporal resolution,
low latency, and high dynamic range. However, their limited spatial resolution
poses challenges for fine-grained perception tasks. In this work, we propose an
ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method based on
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), designed for real-time deployment on
resource-constrained devices. To further reduce model size, we introduce a
novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples
positive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN.
Furthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss
(LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity
consistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance
on multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference
time. The lightweight design enables embedding the module into event cameras or
using it as an efficient front-end preprocessing for downstream vision tasks.

Motivation: 现有的去噪扩散概率模型（DDPMs）在3D物体检测任务中表现出色，但其推理过程中的多步迭代限制了效率。

Method: 提出了一个单阶段全稀疏的3D物体检测网络RSDNet，利用DDPMs的可拆卸潜在框架，学习在潜在特征空间中的去噪过程。

Result: 通过轻量级的去噪网络，如多级去噪自动编码器，RSDNet能有效理解场景分布，实现稳健可靠的检测。同时，改造DDPMs的加噪和去噪机制，提升RSDNet应对多种扰动的能力。

Conclusion: RSDNet在公开基准测试中表现优异，超越现有方法，实现最先进的检测效果。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust
3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching
from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require
multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this,
we propose a \textbf{R}obust single-stage fully \textbf{S}parse 3D object
\textbf{D}etection \textbf{Net}work with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of
DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in
latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level
denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand
scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and
reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising
mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise
samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations.
Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to
perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature
missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a
fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network
design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference,
further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public
benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art detection.

TL;DR: Introduced ReDPO and V.I.P. to reduce computational costs for T2V models without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational cost of deploying T2V models in resource-constrained environments necessitates methods to maintain performance while reducing computational requirements.

Method: Combined distillation method, ReDPO, integrating DPO and SFT with an additional framework (V.I.P.) for dataset curation and online calibrated training.

Result: Achieved parameter reduction of 36.2% and 67.5% on two T2V models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, without degrading performance.

Conclusion: Proposed an effective distillation method (ReDPO) integrating DPO with SFT to reduce computational costs while maintaining or surpassing the performance of T2V models.

Abstract: With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in
resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has
become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge
distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing
distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which
often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to
directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality.
To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO,
that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student
model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than
passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall
performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering
and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online
approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V
models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2%
and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full
models. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both ReDPO and
V.I.P. framework in enabling efficient and high-quality video generation. Our

TL;DR: DiffBrush是一种新的手写文字行生成模型，通过分离风格和多尺度内容学习，在风格模仿和内容准确性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的手写文字生成方法主要集中于孤立的词，但真实的手写文字需要关注个别词及词之间的关系，如垂直对齐和水平间距。因此，生成整行文字成为更有前景的综合任务。

Method: 提出了DiffBrush，一种新的基于扩散的模型，用于生成手写文字行。这个方法通过内容分离的风格学习和多尺度内容学习策略来提高风格模仿和内容准确性。

Result: 实验表明，DiffBrush在生成高质量的文字行方面表现出色，尤其是在风格再现和内容保留方面。

Conclusion: DiffBrush提供了一种有效的手写文字行生成方法，能够准确模仿风格并保持内容的准确性。

Abstract: Existing handwritten text generation methods primarily focus on isolated
words. However, realistic handwritten text demands attention not only to
individual words but also to the relationships between them, such as vertical
alignment and horizontal spacing. Therefore, generating entire text lines
emerges as a more promising and comprehensive task. However, this task poses
significant challenges, including the accurate modeling of complex style
patterns encompassing both intra- and inter-word relationships, and maintaining
content accuracy across numerous characters. To address these challenges, we
propose DiffBrush, a novel diffusion-based model for handwritten text-line
generation. Unlike existing methods, DiffBrush excels in both style imitation
and content accuracy through two key strategies: (1) content-decoupled style
learning, which disentangles style from content to better capture intra-word
and inter-word style patterns by using column- and row-wise masking; and (2)
multi-scale content learning, which employs line and word discriminators to
ensure global coherence and local accuracy of textual content. Extensive
experiments show that DiffBrush excels in generating high-quality text lines,
particularly in style reproduction and content preservation. Code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoPrompt integrates verb and noun actions for better egocentric recognition, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing approaches that treat verb and noun components independently leading to fragmented representations with sub-optimal generalization.

Method: A prompt learning-based framework named EgoPrompt was proposed, which constructs a Unified Prompt Pool space to facilitate interaction between verb and noun component representations through an attention-based mechanism.

Result: EgoPrompt showed superior performance across different datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in within-dataset, cross-dataset, and base-to-novel generalization benchmarks.

Conclusion: EgoPrompt achieves state-of-the-art performance in egocentric action recognition across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for applications in augmented and virtual
reality, egocentric action recognition has emerged as a prominent research
area. It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed
behavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon
(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most
existing approaches treat these two components as independent classification
tasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking
their inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented
representations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these
challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct
the egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting
strategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified
Prompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component
representations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and
nouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair
form. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an
attention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure
the prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training
objective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two
perspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge
Orthogonalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Ego4D,
EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets. The results consistently show that EgoPrompt
achieves state-of-the-art performance across within-dataset, cross-dataset, and
base-to-novel generalization benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of placental diseases via whole slide images (WSIs) is
critical for preventing severe maternal and fetal complications. However, WSI
analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive data
volume. Existing WSI classification methods encounter critical limitations: (1)
inadequate patch selection strategies that either compromise performance or
fail to sufficiently reduce computational demands, and (2) the loss of global
histological context resulting from patch-level processing approaches. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient multimodal framework for
Patient-level placental disease Diagnosis, named EmmPD. Our approach introduces
a two-stage patch selection module that combines parameter-free and learnable
compression strategies, optimally balancing computational efficiency with
critical feature preservation. Additionally, we develop a hybrid multimodal
fusion module that leverages adaptive graph learning to enhance pathological
feature representation and incorporates textual medical reports to enrich
global contextual understanding. Extensive experiments conducted on both a
self-constructed patient-level Placental dataset and two public datasets
demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance.

Conclusion: SDGPA方法可以在没有目标域图像的情况下进行域自适应语义分割，并能够应对源域和目标域之间的重大差距。

Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic segmentation models achieve impressive results
yet remain limited in handling distribution shifts between training and test
data. In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and
Progressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive
semantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text
description of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the
lack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf
text-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring
source domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images
introduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images
cannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic
data, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches
individually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial
precision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented
intermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more
stable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the
impact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy,
ensuring robust learning throughout the training process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
semantic segmentation. The code is available at

Conclusion: BaroPoser通过结合IMU和气压数据，能有效提高非平坦地形上的姿态估计准确性，并超越现有单独使用IMU的技术。

Abstract: In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such
as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due
to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human
motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose
estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat
terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines
IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate
human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric
readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for
both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global
translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh
coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose
representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark
datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.

Abstract: Object detection has achieved remarkable accuracy through deep learning, yet
these improvements often come with increased computational cost, limiting
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD)
provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from
larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique
challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well
as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This
review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods,
distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level,
neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种神经形态雷达框架，用于实时低功耗手势识别，系统实现了超过85％的准确率，是首次使用事件驱动处理框架进行雷达HGR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现有的雷达手势识别（HGR）系统中，通常需要连续采样和处理大量数据，造成了内存、功率和计算资源的浪费。因此，研究一种能够有效降低这些开销的实时、低功耗手势识别系统。

Method: 开发了一个基于生物感知启发的事件驱动架构的神经形态雷达框架。系统包含一个24 GHz多普勒雷达前端和一个定制的神经形态采样器，通过异步sigma-delta编码将中频信号转化为稀疏的尖峰型表示。这些事件由部署在Cortex-M0微控制器上的轻量级神经网络直接处理，实现低延迟推理，无需进行频谱重建。

Result: 在从七个用户收集的五种手势数据集上进行评估，系统实现了超过85％的实时准确率。

Conclusion: 这是首次将生物启发的异步sigma-delta编码和事件驱动处理框架运用于雷达手势识别（HGR）的工作。

Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand
gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by
biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a
custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals
into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding.
These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on
a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring
spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that
continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when
meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and
computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from
seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous
sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based
HGR.

Abstract: The exponential growth in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) usage underscores
the critical need of detecting them at extended distances to ensure safe
operations, especially in densely populated areas. Despite the tremendous
advances made in computer vision through deep learning, the detection of these
small airborne objects remains a formidable challenge. While several datasets
have been developed specifically for drone detection, the need for a more
extensive and diverse collection of drone image data persists, particularly for
long-range detection under varying environmental conditions. We introduce here
the Long Range Drone Detection (LRDD) Version 2 dataset, comprising 39,516
meticulously annotated images, as a second release of the LRDD dataset released
previously. The LRDDv2 dataset enhances the LRDDv1 by incorporating a greater
variety of images, providing a more diverse and comprehensive resource for
drone detection research. What sets LRDDv2 apart is its inclusion of target
range information for over 8,000 images, making it possible to develop
algorithms for drone range estimation. Tailored for long-range aerial object
detection, the majority of LRDDv2's dataset consists of images capturing drones
with 50 or fewer pixels in 1080p resolution. For access to the complete

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的自回归扩散模型在视频生成方面表现出色，但在较长的时间维度上存在局限性，具体表现为错误累积导致的时间漂移及长视频合成中的并行化困难。

Method: 我们提出了一种小说的规划后填充框架，以微观规划到宏观规划(MMPL)为中心，用于长视频生成。

Result: 广泛的实验表明我们的方法在长视频生成的质量和稳定性方面超过了现有模型。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在长视频生成的质量和稳定性方面优于现有模型。

Abstract: Current autoregressive diffusion models excel at video generation but are
generally limited to short temporal durations. Our theoretical analysis
indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal
drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video
synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)
for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire
video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning.
Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within
each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide
high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment
keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of
micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments.
Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames
in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of
autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive
Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive
video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms
existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated
videos and comparison results are in our project page.

TL;DR: 为了恢复极暗图像中的细节，提出了一个高效的双阶段方法，利用残差傅里叶引导模块和Mamba模块进行亮度恢复和纹理细化，实验显示此方法在细节恢复上性能显著改善同时保持了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恢复在极暗图像中丢失的精细细节，同时解决噪声污染的问题，因为现有增强方法无法保持细致的细节和清晰的边缘，且在文本和边缘检测等下游应用中效果有限。

Method: 提出了一个专注于细节恢复的双阶段方法：第一阶段引入了残差傅里叶引导模块(RFGM)，通过残差连接在频域中有效恢复整体亮度；第二阶段使用互补的Mamba模块进行纹理结构细化，包含Patch Mamba和Grad Mamba模块。

Result: 通过在多个基准数据集和下游应用上进行广泛实验，显示该方法显著改善了细节恢复性能，同时保持了效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的模块是轻量级的，可以无缝集成到现有的基于傅里叶的框架中，且计算开销最小。

Abstract: Recovering fine-grained details in extremely dark images remains challenging
due to severe structural information loss and noise corruption. Existing
enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges,
limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge
detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage
approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we
introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores
global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and
inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust
priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error
accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs
complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure
refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled
patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained
details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on
high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and
prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications
demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance
while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight
and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with
minimal computational overhead. Code is available at

TL;DR: AFP通过减少处理帧数量来提高视频问答效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型应用于视频问答面临高token成本和上下文稀释的问题，并且当前关键帧选择方法存在显著的时间冗余。

Method: 提出了一种名为自适应帧修剪（AFP）的后处理方法，通过自适应层次聚类算法在融合的ResNet-50和CLIP特征空间上识别并合并视觉回声，并引入基于文本的语义图来补偿信息损失。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和VideoMME基准测试中，AFP方法减少了最多达86.9%的视频帧和83.2%的输入token，并提高了准确性。

Conclusion: AFP方法减少了需要处理的视频帧数量，降低了输入token数，并通过提供高质量的特征帧提高了效率和准确性。

Abstract: The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to
Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost
of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled
frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where
excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution.
Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective,
still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To
address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel
post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP
employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and
CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single
representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a
lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with
minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach
demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total
input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality
set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves
accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon
publication.

Motivation: 夜间场景拍摄的图像由于能见度严重下降，影响了有效的内容识别。现有的低光图像增强方法在极暗环境中难以有效工作。

Method: 提出CIVQLLIE框架，通过因果推理中的离散表示学习来增强图像。采用向量量化（VQ）技术，将连续图像特征映射到从大规模高质量图像学习的视觉令牌离散码本中。通过像素级因果干预（PCI）、特征感知因果干预（FCI）以及高频细节重建模块（HDRM）进行多层次干预。

Conclusion: 提出了一种通过多层级因果干预技术提升低光图像增强效果的新方法，弥补现有数据驱动模型和物理模型的不足。

Abstract: Images captured in nighttime scenes suffer from severely reduced visibility,
hindering effective content perception. Current low-light image enhancement
(LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping
networks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling
under extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on
simplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that
leverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal
reasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps
continuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from
large-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,
encoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of
degradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to
distribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.
Therefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to
systematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level
Causal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with
the brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a
Feature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective
Attention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by
illumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while
enhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible
feature-level intervention. Finally, during decoding, the High-frequency Detail
Reconstruction Module (HDRM) leverages structural information preserved in the
matched codebook representations to reconstruct fine details using deformable
convolution techniques.

TL;DR: WaMo是一种基于小波的多频特征提取框架，通过细致捕捉运动细节实现了文本与3D动作的精确匹配，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 匹配3D动作与文本的挑战主要在于人体结构的复杂性及其空间-时间动态。现有方法通常依赖于通用编码方式，未能很好辨别不同身体部位及其动态，影响了语义精确对齐。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的基于小波的多频特征提取框架WaMo，包含轨迹小波分解、轨迹小波重建和无序运动序列预测三个关键组件。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上Rsum指标分别提高了17.0%和18.2%，超越了现有的最新方法。

Conclusion: WaMo通过捕捉身体关节的多分辨率运动细节，实现了动作与文本的精细对齐，证明了其在文本-动作检索上的优越性。

Abstract: Text-Motion Retrieval (TMR) aims to retrieve 3D motion sequences semantically
relevant to text descriptions. However, matching 3D motions with text remains
highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate structure of human body and
its spatial-temporal dynamics. Existing approaches often overlook these
complexities, relying on general encoding methods that fail to distinguish
different body parts and their dynamics, limiting precise semantic alignment.
To address this, we propose WaMo, a novel wavelet-based multi-frequency feature
extraction framework. It fully captures part-specific and time-varying motion
details across multiple resolutions on body joints, extracting discriminative
motion features to achieve fine-grained alignment with texts. WaMo has three
key components: (1) Trajectory Wavelet Decomposition decomposes motion signals
into frequency components that preserve both local kinematic details and global
motion semantics. (2) Trajectory Wavelet Reconstruction uses learnable inverse
wavelet transforms to reconstruct original joint trajectories from extracted
features, ensuring the preservation of essential spatial-temporal information.
(3) Disordered Motion Sequence Prediction reorders shuffled motion sequences to
improve the learning of inherent temporal coherence, enhancing motion-text
alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate WaMo's superiority, achieving
17.0\% and 18.2\% improvements in $Rsum$ on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于海森矩阵的语言模型PTQ方法在视觉语言模型中表现不佳，因为它们没有考虑视觉令牌的冗余和文本令牌的限制。

Method: VLMQ框架通过优化一个注重重要性的目标来增强海森矩阵，保留了与并行权重更新的兼容性，并通过一个轻量级的块级后向传递计算重要性因子。

Result: VLMQ在多个基准测试中实现了SOTA性能，尤其是在低比特量化的情况下。具体来说，在MME-RealWorld的2-bit量化下，性能提升了16.45%。

Conclusion: VLMQ方法能够在低位量化设置下实现视觉语言模型的SOTA性能，解决了现有方法在VLMs中的性能下降问题。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for
compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining.
While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models
(LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.},
limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs.
However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during
quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs.
Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ
framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token
redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an
enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining
compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and
effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise
backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations.
Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit
settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement
on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

TL;DR: FedPromo是一个高效适应大型模型的联邦学习框架，减少了计算资源消耗并保持用户隐私，实验表明其在有限资源客户端环境中超过了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于模型规模的扩大，传统联邦学习方法需要客户端设备提供显著的计算资源，这在很多情况下是不切实际的。因此需要一种高效的框架来适应客户端只遇到的新领域。

Method: FedPromo遵循两阶段顺序：首先在服务器端进行知识蒸馏，使一个大型基础模型与紧凑模型的表示对齐；然后，将紧凑模型编码器部署到客户端学习可训练分类器，最终这些分类器汇总并传回基础模型。

Result: 通过创新的正则化策略，FedPromo实现了分散式的多域学习，达成性能、隐私和资源效率的平衡。

Conclusion: FedPromo通过优化轻量级代理模型显著减少计算开销，同时保持隐私，提供高效的多域学习解决方案。实验结果表明其在资源有限的客户端环境中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an established paradigm for training deep learning
models on decentralized data. However, as the size of the models grows,
conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on
client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel
framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models
stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients.
Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo
optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational
overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process:
first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a
large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact
counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to
client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These
classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the
foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct
access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework
enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy,
and resource efficiency. Extensive experiments on five image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that FedPromo outperforms existing methods while
assuming limited-resource clients.

Result: 新方法在视觉质量和推理效率上均优于现有的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了在只用一步采样的情况下达到优秀的复原效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revealed powerful potential in all-in-one image
restoration (AiOIR), which is talented in generating abundant texture details.
The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the
pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often
suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse
degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method,
Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration
performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models.
Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to
capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then,
parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to
enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation
types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into
the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration
approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的深度学习方法主要利用模式识别，而忽略了病变发展时的解剖学背景，放射科医生需要精准的解剖学知识来界定病变。本文提出了一种框架以缩小该差距。

Method: GRASP是一种模块化的即插即用框架，通过伪标签整合和特征对齐来利用现有解剖分割模型，从而增强病理分割模型。在标准病理优化过程中整合，无需重新训练解剖组件。

Result: GRASP在两个PET/CT数据集上的评估中获得了多个评价指标和不同架构的最高排名。其双解剖注入策略有效地融合了解剖学背景。

Conclusion: GRASP是一个能够显著提升病理分割模型性能的框架，其通过引入解剖学上下文成功填补了模式识别与解剖学理解之间的空白。

Abstract: Radiologists rely on anatomical understanding to accurately delineate
pathologies, yet most current deep learning approaches use pure pattern
recognition and ignore the anatomical context in which pathologies develop. To
narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the
Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances
pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation
models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous
approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP
integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining
anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct
systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings. We
find that GRASP consistently achieves top rankings across multiple evaluation
metrics and diverse architectures. The framework's dual anatomy injection
strategy, combining anatomical pseudo-labels as input channels with
transformer-guided anatomical feature fusion, effectively incorporates
anatomical context.

Motivation: 目前的步态识别方法在面对新数据集时通常需要重新训练，而重新训练的模型在保持以前数据集的知识方面往往面临困难，导致性能显著下降。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种称为GaitAdapt的持续步态识别任务，以支持步态识别能力随时间逐步增强。

Method: 本文提出了一种称为GaitAdapter的非重播持续学习方法来进行步态识别。该方法结合了GaitPartition自适应知识模块，利用图神经网络汇聚当前数据中的常见步态模式，并将其构建为图向量存储库。随后，这个存储库用于提高新任务中步态特征的判别能力。此外，还引入了基于负样本的欧几里得距离稳定性方法（EDSN），确保新增加的不同类别步态样本在之前和当前任务中保持相似的相对空间分布。

Conclusion: GaitAdapter成功解决了持续步态识别任务中的知识遗忘问题，并提升了步态特征的判别能力。

Abstract: Current gait recognition methodologies generally necessitate retraining when

which supports the progressive enhancement of gait recognition capabilities
over time and is systematically categorized according to various evaluation
scenarios. Additionally, we propose GaitAdapter, a non-replay continual
learning approach for gait recognition. This approach integrates the
GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module, employing graph neural networks
to aggregate common gait patterns from current data into a repository
constructed from graph vectors. Subsequently, this repository is used to
improve the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns. We also introduce a
Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) based on negative pairs, which
ensures that newly added gait samples from different classes maintain similar
relative spatial distributions across both previous and current gait tasks,
thereby alleviating the impact of task changes on the distinguishability of
original domain features. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GaitAdapter
effectively retains gait knowledge acquired from diverse tasks, exhibiting
markedly superior discriminative capability compared to alternative methods.

TL;DR: NAVIA是一个新方法，通过信息增强来解决Test-Time Adaptation中因Token聚合导致的信息损失问题，在性能提升的同时降低了推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Test-Time Adaptation方法在处理Vision Transformers面临的分布变化时，往往带来显著的计算开销，限制了其在资源受限的实用场景中的应用。因此，本文探讨如何在降低推理成本的同时保持适应能力。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为NAVIA的方法，通过信息增强来中和Token聚合的影响，特别是直接增强[CLS] token嵌入并在ViTs的浅层中加入自适应偏置。这些增强经过熵最小化优化，可以恢复因Token聚合导致的信息损失。

Result: NAVIA在多个分布不一致的基准测试中表现出色，比最先进的方法提高了超过2.5%的性能，同时推理延迟减少超过20%。

Conclusion: NAVIA成功解决了ETTA问题，不仅显著提升了性能，还有效降低了推理的延迟。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting
Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training
data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational
overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world
scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods
merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit
efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly
integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of
TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a
theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that
token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully
mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this
insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation
\textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}).
Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate
adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We
theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy
minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive
experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that
NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while
achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively
addressing the ETTA challenge.

TL;DR: 本文提出DepthGait框架，通过结合RGB生成的深度图和轮廓图，改善步态识别性能，实验结果显示其达到极高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D轮廓和骨架无法充分捕捉视点变化和步态的细节，需要一种新的框架来提高步态识别的能力。

Method: 引入RGB生成的深度图和轮廓，并通过多尺度和跨级融合方案提高步态识别性能。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，DepthGait方法实现了与同类方法相比的最新性能，并在具有挑战性的数据集上取得了出色的Rank-1平均准确率。

Conclusion: DepthGait框架通过结合RGB生成的深度图和2D轮廓，实现了对人类步态的更精细识别。

Abstract: Robust gait recognition requires highly discriminative representations, which
are closely tied to input modalities. While binary silhouettes and skeletons
have dominated recent literature, these 2D representations fall short of
capturing sufficient cues that can be exploited to handle viewpoint variations,
and capture finer and meaningful details of gait. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework, termed DepthGait, that incorporates RGB-derived depth maps and
silhouettes for enhanced gait recognition. Specifically, apart from the 2D
silhouette representation of the human body, the proposed pipeline explicitly
estimates depth maps from a given RGB image sequence and uses them as a new
modality to capture discriminative features inherent in human locomotion. In
addition, a novel multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme has also been
developed to bridge the modality gap between depth maps and silhouettes.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
DepthGait achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to peer methods and
attains an impressive mean rank-1 accuracy on the challenging datasets.

Method: 研究提出SCFlow框架，通过流匹配技术学习在纠缠和解缠表示之间的双向映射。这种方法避免了限制性的高斯先验，并使用合成数据集进行训练。

Result: SCFlow不仅在可控生成任务中表现优异，还能在ImageNet-1k和WikiArt中实现零样本情况下的高性能，证明了解耦自然源于可逆合并过程。

Conclusion: SCFlow框架通过可逆合并风格和内容，自然实现了风格和内容的解耦。此方法在处理生成任务时表现出色，并在ImageNet-1k和WikiArt的零样本设置中展现了竞争性能。

Abstract: Explicitly disentangling style and content in vision models remains
challenging due to their semantic overlap and the subjectivity of human
perception. Existing methods propose separation through generative or
discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of
disentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit
disentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing
separation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework
that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled
representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training
solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible
disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on
arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion
models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51
styles $\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement
through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks,
we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot
settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that
disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

Motivation: 光谱混合解析是各种高光谱图像应用中的关键预处理步骤。为了提高混合解析的准确性，研究开发了一种新的方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，STVMLU方法在解混性能方面优于其他传统算法。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，与其他算法相比，STVMLU具有更好的性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing aims at estimating material signatures (known as
endmembers) and the corresponding proportions (referred to abundances), which
is a critical preprocessing step in various hyperspectral imagery applications.
This study develops a novel approach called sparsity and total variation (TV)
constrained multilayer linear unmixing (STVMLU) for hyperspectral imagery.
Specifically, based on a multilayer matrix factorization model, to improve the
accuracy of unmixing, a TV constraint is incorporated to consider adjacent
spatial similarity. Additionally, a L1/2-norm sparse constraint is adopted to
effectively characterize the sparsity of the abundance matrix. For optimizing
the STVMLU model, the method of alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is employed, which allows for the simultaneous extraction of endmembers
and their corresponding abundance matrix. Experimental results illustrate the
enhanced performance of the proposed STVMLU when compared to other algorithms.

Method: 提出了一个多代理协作框架，包括规划、执行、判断和回答代理，通过定义明确的角色和有效的协作来解决问题。

Result: MACT在文档相关和非文档相关任务上表现优秀，特别是在长视觉上下文和复杂推理任务上。

Conclusion: MACT框架在处理长视觉上下文和复杂推理方面表现出色，并在15个基准中领先13个。它通过混合奖励建模和代理特定的测试时间缩放来扩展框架的能力。

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists,
remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction
capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and
complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks.
To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with
Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual
question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e.,
planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles
and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies
correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming
conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries
of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific
abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time
scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on
their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and
non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller
parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical
tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts
and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top
three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code

Motivation: 当前无监督视频分割任务由于缺乏监督信号和视觉场景的复杂性，通常依赖于大型且计算昂贵的神经架构。为此，提出了一种有效的轻量级知识转移方法。

Method: 提出了一个名为SlotMatch的知识蒸馏框架，通过余弦相似性对齐教师和学生槽位，无需额外的蒸馏目标或辅助监督。

Result: 使用SlotMatch框架的学生模型在参数和运行速度方面显著优于教师模型SlotContrast，并且在无监督视频分割任务中超越之前的模型。

Conclusion: 通过简单的知识蒸馏框架SlotMatch，将对象中心表示转移至轻量级学生模型，达到甚至超越教师模型，同时减少参数和加快速度。

Abstract: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task,
especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity
of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on
slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural
architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation
framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a
lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns
corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no
additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of
SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating
that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two
datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our
distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches
and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running
1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video
segmentation models.

TL;DR: Fd-CycleGAN improves perceptual quality and generalization in image translation using local pixel semantics and frequency-aware supervision, outperforming CycleGAN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance latent representation learning and improve mode diversity in image-to-image translation tasks.

Method: Fd-CycleGAN incorporates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision.

Result: Fd-CycleGAN demonstrates superior perceptual quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity compared to CycleGAN and other methods.

Conclusion: Fd-CycleGAN significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks and achieves superior perceptual quality.

Abstract: This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation
framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data
distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach
integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to
capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural
coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics,
including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly
quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both
spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we
conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a
synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and
other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual
quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in
low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution
characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically
consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent
learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with
promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and
medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with
diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our
lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and
qualitative output.

Abstract: X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of
artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation
models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved.
However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic
capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale
multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth
medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of
relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert
Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs
and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we
adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the
knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and
retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention.
Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph,
input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of
our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source

Conclusion: IMAC框架在处理EEG信号跨域数据分布偏移方面表现优异，能够有效提高分类准确率，尤其是在跨主体和跨中心验证场景下。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges
due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode
configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across
domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and
imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of
cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To
address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC
first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional
unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations.
Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods,
IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a
channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high
resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach
simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal
instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for
robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a
disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial
information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity
while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across
10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance,
achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and
cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under
both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods
by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification
accuracy.

Abstract: Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) aims to select informative samples for
annotation without prior knowledge, which is important for improving annotation
efficiency and model performance under a limited annotation budget in medical
image analysis. Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and
limited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained
Foundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a
potential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated,
with a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we
propose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical
image analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets
under different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation
tasks from diverse medical modalities. It is also the first CSAL benchmark that
evaluates both the feature extraction and sample selection stages. Our
experimental results reveal that: 1) Most FMs are effective feature extractors
for CSAL, with DINO family performing the best in segmentation; 2) The
performance differences of these FMs are large in segmentation tasks, while
small for classification; 3) Different sample selection strategies should be
considered in CSAL on different datasets, with Active Learning by Processing
Surprisal (ALPS) performing the best in segmentation while RepDiv leading for

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable progress in
image and video synthesis, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the
standard tool for high-fidelity, controllable generation. However, despite
their practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with
different stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step
regimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and
analyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely
sensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative
strength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is
intrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and
causes exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To
address this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive
guidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps
based on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method
is lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible
with standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image
(SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables
up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality,
robustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm
the generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and
hyperparameters. Our findings highlight the critical role of stepwise guidance
adaptation in unlocking the full potential of fast flow-based generative
models.

Abstract: Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models have shown remarkable
performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). With fine-tuning on a single
auxiliary dataset, the model enables cross-category anomaly detection on
diverse datasets covering industrial defects and medical lesions. Compared to
manually designed prompts, prompt learning eliminates the need for expert
knowledge and trial-and-error. However, it still faces the following
challenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and
diverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to
unseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category
information, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic
subspace. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Prompt Synthesis
(CoPS), a novel framework that synthesizes dynamic prompts conditioned on
visual features to enhance ZSAD performance. Specifically, we extract
representative normal and anomaly prototypes from fine-grained patch features
and explicitly inject them into prompts, enabling adaptive state modeling.
Given the sparsity of class labels, we leverage a variational autoencoder to
model semantic image features and implicitly fuse varied class tokens into
prompts. Additionally, integrated with our spatially-aware alignment mechanism,
extensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by 2.5% AUROC in both classification and segmentation across 13 industrial and
medical datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/cqylunlun/CoPS.

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，我们提出的框架在很大程度上优于先进的图像和视频去除摩尔纹的方法。

Abstract: Moire patterns, unwanted color artifacts in images and videos, arise from the
interference between spatially high-frequency scene contents and the spatial
discrete sampling of digital cameras. Existing demoireing methods primarily
rely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical
challenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real
textures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while
removing moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera
framework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus
(retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one
defocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We
use the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture,
so as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise
demoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to
address any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and
defocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the
demoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional
training loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step
involves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the
CNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework largely

*Zilin Chen,Shengnan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于结肠镜视频息肉检测的稳健框架AVPDN，其中包含两个模块，以解决快速相机运动带来的背景噪声问题。实验表明该方法表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统结肠镜视频由于快速相机移动带来的背景噪声，影响场景结构完整性并提高误报风险。针对这些挑战，提出了一种多尺度视频结肠镜息肉检测的稳健框架。

Method: 提出了一种称为Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network (AVPDN) 的框架。包括两个关键模块：自适应特征交互和增强(AFIA)模块以及尺度感知上下文集成(SACI)模块。AFIA模块通过三分支架构增强特征表示，并利用多种注意力机制和通道随机操作进行信息交换。SACI模块则通过使用不同感受野的扩张卷积进行多尺度特征集成。

Result: 该方法在多个具有挑战性的公共基准上进行了实验，表现出竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，该方法在视频结肠镜息肉检测任务中表现出色，具有良好的效果和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate detection of polyps is of critical importance for the early and
intermediate stages of colorectal cancer diagnosis. Compared to static images,
dynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which
can facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike
fixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera
movement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural
integrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address
these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network
(AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy
videos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction
and Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI)
module. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature
representation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling,
sparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in
feature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch
information exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen
multi-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying
receptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales,
thereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on
several challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive
performance in video-based polyp detection tasks.

TL;DR: 本文分析了 LVLMs 中幻觉现象增加的原因，并提出了一种新的解码策略（IKOD）来减轻这种现象，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs 在较长序列中幻觉现象增加，与视觉注意力减弱有关，因此需要找到一种方法来增强视觉注意以减少幻觉。

Method: 提出了一种图像注意引导的关键值合并协同解码策略（IKOD），通过在解码过程中进行关键值合并来生成更多关注图像的序列，以减轻注意力衰退和抑制幻觉。

Result: IKOD 在大量实验中表现出了卓越的效果，减轻了幻觉现象，并提高了 LVLMs 的综合能力。

Conclusion: IKOD 方法显著减轻了幻觉现象，提高了 LVLMs 的综合能力，不需要额外的训练或外部工具，适用于各种模型。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face
the inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative
inference, which often leads to "hallucinations", outputs that are not grounded
in the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these
issues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational
cost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit
a long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows,
yet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive
research into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship
between this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify
a consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input
diminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key
factor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these
insights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative
Decoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more
image-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with
higher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those
from the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and
suppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost.
Extensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks
demonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and
improving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no
additional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient
framework applicable to various models.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管已有研究试图保护摄影图像不被生成模型操控，但视频内容编辑的保护仍然存在显著差距。提出这一方法是为了填补该保护缺口。

Method: 提出了一种名为VideoGuard的视频保护方法。该方法通过引入几乎不可察觉的扰动来干扰生成扩散模型的运行。采用联合帧优化，将所有视频帧视为一个优化实体，并将视频运动信息融合到优化目标中，以迫使模型生成不合理和不一致的输出。最后，通过优化管道来优化这种扰动，并使用客观指标和主观指标验证方法的有效性。

Result: VideoGuard方法能够有效地保护视频免受未经授权的恶意编辑，其保护性能优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究证明了VideoGuard方法可以有效地保护视频内容不被未经授权的恶意编辑，其性能优于所有基线方法。

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative
models can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled
manner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these
capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has
attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative
models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to
video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named
VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious
editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly
unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended
generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and
inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying
image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield
video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint
frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.
Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization
objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce
outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to
optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and
subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results
show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the
baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖于基于大规模模型的提示级建模，由于T2I扩散模型的输入标记容量有限，常导致个性化不准确。

Method: 提出DrUM方法，将用户画像和基于变压器的适配器结合起来，通过潜在空间的条件级建模实现个性化生成。

Result: DrUM方法在大规模数据集上表现出色。

Conclusion: DrUM方法展现了强大的性能，能够集成到开源文本编码器中，且无需额外的微调，与常用的现有基础T2I模型兼容。

Abstract: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate
individual user preferences into the generation process with minimal user
intervention. However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling
with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the
limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these
limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling
with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through
condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source
text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models
without requiring additional fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出SODA框架，用于检测文本-图像生成模型中的对象偏见，发现特定人口群体与视觉属性间存在强关联，从而加剧了刻板印象并强调审查生成模型的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管之前的研究主要关注人类形象中的偏见，但更微妙且普遍存在的现象——生成对象中的人口统计偏见尚未得到足够关注。该研究旨在填补这一领域的空白。

Method: 该研究使用SODA（Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit）框架，系统性地测量生成对象的偏见。通过对2700张图像进行分析，这些图像由三个最先进的模型在五个对象类别中生成，比较带有人口统计特征的对象与中性提示生成的对象的视觉属性。

Result: 通过分析发现特定人口群体与视觉属性之间存在强关联，这些模式不仅反映并加强了众所周知的刻板印象，也揭示了更微妙且不直观的偏见。其中某些模型生成的输出多样性较低，从而加剧了与中性提示相比的视觉差异。

Conclusion: 通过引入SODA框架，该研究揭示了文本-图像生成模型中存在的对象的偏见问题，并强调了对生成模型进行系统性的偏见审查的重要性，以促进更负责任的AI开发。

Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on
biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive
phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce
SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for
systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes
of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those
from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art
models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories.
Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between
specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color
patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and
reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive
biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which
in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our
proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing
how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this
as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

Motivation: 解决DiT模型在极低比特量化时的性能退化问题。

Method: 提出一个高效和精确的后训练量化框架LRQ-DiT，通过创新的双对数量化（TLQ）和自适应旋转方案（ARS）。

Result: LRQ-DiT在多个数据集和不同比特宽度设置下有效进行低位量化，并超越现有PTQ基准。

Conclusion: LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved impressive performance in
text-to-image generation. However, their high computational cost and large
parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained
scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce
memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from
severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two
key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model
weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform
quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;
(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated
values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in
specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these
issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We
introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with
the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an
Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or
outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating
the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX
under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,
and sDCI datasets. LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while
preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.

Motivation: 建筑行业资源消耗大，质量监控通常依赖手动方法，而现有分割方法不适用于包含大量微小颗粒的图像，因此需要开发高效的自动化视觉方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的ParticleSAM方法有效应用于包含小而密集物体的图像分割中，具有潜在的跨领域应用价值。

Abstract: The construction industry represents a major sector in terms of resource
consumption. Recycled construction material has high reuse potential, but
quality monitoring of the aggregates is typically still performed with manual
methods. Vision-based machine learning methods could offer a faster and more
efficient solution to this problem, but existing segmentation methods are by
design not directly applicable to images with hundreds of small particles. In
this paper, we propose ParticleSAM, an adaptation of the segmentation
foundation model to images with small and dense objects such as the ones often
encountered in construction material particles. Moreover, we create a new dense
multi-particle dataset simulated from isolated particle images with the
assistance of an automated data generation and labeling pipeline. This dataset
serves as a benchmark for visual material quality control automation while our
segmentation approach has the potential to be valuable in application areas
beyond construction where small-particle segmentation is needed. Our
experimental results validate the advantages of our method by comparing to the
original SAM method both in quantitative and qualitative experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 考虑到稀疏字典学习在图像处理任务如图像恢复中的重要性，研究稀疏性质对于恢复质量的影响是至关重要的，因此，我们探索如何在不影响恢复质量的情况下最大化稀疏性。

Method: 本文使用迭代收缩方法（iterative shrinkage methods）来解决稀疏字典学习（SDL）问题，并分析不同优化方法在解的稀疏性方面的表现。

Result: 结果表明，不同的优化方法导致不同的稀疏性机制，并且一般来说，高稀疏性不会降低恢复质量。

Conclusion: 我们展示了不同的优化方法在解的稀疏性方面存在不同的稀疏性机制，高稀疏性通常不会影响恢复质量，即使恢复的图像与学习数据库有很大不同。

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) is a fundamental technique that is useful
for many image processing tasks. As an example we consider here image recovery,
where SDL can be cast as a nonsmooth optimization problem. For this kind of
problems, iterative shrinkage methods represent a powerful class of algorithms
that are subject of ongoing research. Sparsity is an important property of the
learned solutions, as exactly the sparsity enables efficient further processing
or storage. The sparsity implies that a recovered image is determined as a
combination of a number of dictionary elements that is as low as possible.
Therefore, the question arises, to which degree sparsity should be enforced in
SDL in order to not compromise recovery quality. In this paper we focus on the
sparsity of solutions that can be obtained using a variety of optimization
methods. It turns out that there are different sparsity regimes depending on
the method in use. Furthermore, we illustrate that high sparsity does in
general not compromise recovery quality, even if the recovered image is quite
different from the learning database.

Motivation: 现有模型难以捕捉医学数据中的复杂语义关系，导致检索结果不可靠。该研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了Prototype-Enhanced Confidence Modeling (PECM)框架，引入多级原型和双流信心评估机制来提高语义变异性的捕获能力。

Result: 在多个不同数据集和任务中，PECM方法获得了性能提升最多为10.17%的结果。

Conclusion: PECM框架在解决跨模态检索任务中取得了显著的性能提升，提供了新的技术水平。

Abstract: In cross-modal retrieval tasks, such as image-to-report and report-to-image
retrieval, accurately aligning medical images with relevant text reports is
essential but challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and variability in
medical data. Existing models often struggle to capture the nuanced,
multi-level semantic relationships in radiology data, leading to unreliable
retrieval results. To address these issues, we propose the Prototype-Enhanced
Confidence Modeling (PECM) framework, which introduces multi-level prototypes
for each modality to better capture semantic variability and enhance retrieval
robustness. PECM employs a dual-stream confidence estimation that leverages
prototype similarity distributions and an adaptive weighting mechanism to
control the impact of high-uncertainty data on retrieval rankings. Applied to
radiology image-report datasets, our method achieves significant improvements
in retrieval precision and consistency, effectively handling data ambiguity and
advancing reliability in complex clinical scenarios. We report results on
multiple different datasets and tasks including fully supervised and zero-shot
retrieval obtaining performance gains of up to 10.17%, establishing in new
state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 基于指令的服装编辑能够通过自然语言实现精确的图像修改，在时尚设计和定制中具有广泛的应用。然而，这项任务需要理解服装特定的语义和属性依赖，而现有的高质量指令-图像配对资源稀缺，手动注释成本高且难以规模化。

Abstract: Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via
natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization.
Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific
semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the
scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is
costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data
synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise
instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To
address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a
garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories
aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced
and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit
Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies
between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during
construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate
triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the
first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing. The

Motivation: 在有限标注情况下，希望通过利用其他领域的知识来实现医学图像的有效分割。

Method: 提出了一种不需要训练的跨域少样本医学图像分割（CD-FSMIS）模型，采用多中心自适应不确定性提示（MAUP）策略，将基础模型Segment Anything Model（SAM）应用于CD-FSMIS任务。

Result: 通过预训练DINOv2特征编码器，MAUP在三个医学数据集上实现了精确的分割结果，而无需额外训练。

Conclusion: MAUP实现了与多个常规CD-FSMIS模型和无训练FSMIS模型相比的精确医学图像分割，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Cross-domain Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation (CD-FSMIS) is a potential
solution for segmenting medical images with limited annotation using knowledge
from other domains. The significant performance of current CD-FSMIS models
relies on the heavily training procedure over other source medical domains,
which degrades the universality and ease of model deployment. With the
development of large visual models of natural images, we propose a
training-free CD-FSMIS model that introduces the Multi-center Adaptive
Uncertainty-aware Prompting (MAUP) strategy for adapting the foundation model
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is trained with natural images, into the
CD-FSMIS task. To be specific, MAUP consists of three key innovations: (1)
K-means clustering based multi-center prompts generation for comprehensive
spatial coverage, (2) uncertainty-aware prompts selection that focuses on the
challenging regions, and (3) adaptive prompt optimization that can dynamically
adjust according to the target region complexity. With the pre-trained DINOv2
feature encoder, MAUP achieves precise segmentation results across three
medical datasets without any additional training compared with several
conventional CD-FSMIS models and training-free FSMIS model. The source code is

Motivation: 现有的终生行人再识别（LReID）方法在保存旧知识与适应新信息之间的平衡上存在困难，忽视了特定分布意识和跨域统一知识学习。为了克服这些限制，我们提出了新的方法。

Method: 我们提出了一种新的分布感知知识统一和关联（DKUA）框架，包括分布感知模型、自适应知识整合（AKC）、统一知识关联（UKA）和基于分布的知识迁移（DKT）。

Result: 我们的DKUA方法在抗遗忘和泛化能力方面的表现超出现有方法，平均提高了7.6%的mAP和5.3%的R@1。

Conclusion: 实验结果显示，我们的DKUA在抗遗忘和泛化能力方面，分别提高了7.6%和5.3%的平均mAP和R@1值，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) encounters a key challenge:
balancing the preservation of old knowledge with adaptation to new information.
Existing LReID methods typically employ knowledge distillation to enforce
representation alignment. However, these approaches ignore two crucial aspects:
specific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning,
both of which are essential for addressing this challenge. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and
association (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each
instance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a
distribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the
current domain into the domain-specific representations with the different
domain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,
we propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the
unified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further
mitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)
mechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly
model inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally,
distribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current
domain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center,
improving adaptation capacity. Experimental results show our DKUA outperforms
the existing methods by 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement on
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively. Our code will be
publicly released.

Motivation: 现有的缝合方法在面对组织丢失、形态失真和染色不一致等挑战时表现不佳，难以在大规模组织分析中应用。

Result: SemanticStitcher在三个不同的数据集上进行了实验，结果显示其在边界匹配的正确性方面持续优于现有技术。

Conclusion: SemanticStitcher显著提升了全装载幻灯片（WMS）的形态匹配精度和重建效果。

Abstract: In histopathology, tissue samples are often larger than a standard microscope
slide, making stitching of multiple fragments necessary to process entire
structures such as tumors. Automated stitching is a prerequisite for scaling
analysis, but is challenging due to possible tissue loss during preparation,
inhomogeneous morphological distortion, staining inconsistencies, missing
regions due to misalignment on the slide, or frayed tissue edges. This limits
state-of-the-art stitching methods using boundary shape matching algorithms to
reconstruct artificial whole mount slides (WMS). Here, we introduce
SemanticStitcher using latent feature representations derived from a visual
histopathology foundation model to identify neighboring areas in different
fragments. Robust pose estimation based on a large number of semantic matching
candidates derives a mosaic of multiple fragments to form the WMS. Experiments
on three different histopathology datasets demonstrate that SemanticStitcher
yields robust WMS mosaicing and consistently outperforms the state of the art
in correct boundary matches.

Abstract: Emotional Image Content Generation (EICG) aims to generate semantically clear
and emotionally faithful images based on given emotion categories, with broad
application prospects. While recent text-to-image diffusion models excel at
generating concrete concepts, they struggle with the complexity of abstract
emotions. There have also emerged methods specifically designed for EICG, but
they excessively rely on word-level attribute labels for guidance, which suffer
from semantic incoherence, ambiguity, and limited scalability. To address these
challenges, we propose CoEmoGen, a novel pipeline notable for its semantic
coherence and high scalability. Specifically, leveraging multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), we construct high-quality captions focused on
emotion-triggering content for context-rich semantic guidance. Furthermore,
inspired by psychological insights, we design a Hierarchical Low-Rank

TL;DR: 首次研究将深度学习衍生的视网膜特征与脂质组学亚类整合，揭示了视网膜微血管结构变化与循环脂质谱的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视网膜微血管成像被认为是评估全身血管和代谢健康的非侵入性方法，但脂质组学与视网膜血管的关系仍不充分研究。

Method: 使用Spearman相关分析和Benjamini-Hochberg假发现率调整（BH-FDR）来分析脂质亚类与十个视网膜微血管特征之间的关系。

Result: 自由脂肪酸与视网膜血管的扭曲度相关，胆固醇酯与动脉和静脉的平均宽度相关；而二酰基甘油和三酰基甘油与小动脉和小静脉的宽度和复杂性呈负相关。

Conclusion: 视网膜血管结构反映了不同的循环脂质谱，支持作为系统代谢健康的非侵入性标志。

Abstract: Retinal microvascular imaging is increasingly recognised as a non invasive
method for evaluating systemic vascular and metabolic health. However, the
association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This
study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty
acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl
esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large
population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the
interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits,
applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for
statistical significance.
  Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE
correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and
TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles
and venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects
distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive
marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep
learning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy
cohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes
independent of disease status or treatment effects.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新颖的异常合成方法ARAS，并在其基础上提出了QARAD框架。实验表明，该框架在异常检测任务中表现优异，实现了更快的合成速度和更高的检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散和粗糙修补的异常合成方法存在结构缺陷，如微结构不连续性、有限的语义可控性和低效的生成。

Method: 引入ARAS，一种语言条件下的自回归异常合成方法，通过token锚定的潜在编辑，精准地将文本指定的缺陷注入正常图像。采用硬门控自回归操作符和无训练、上下文保持的遮蔽采样内核。

Result: 通过质量感知的重加权异常检测框架（QARAD），提出一种动态加权策略，利用双编码模型计算图像-文本相似度分数，强调高质量的合成样本。在MVTec AD、VisA和BTAD三个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，QARAD在图像和像素级异常检测任务中优于SOTA方法，实现了更高的准确性、鲁棒性和较扩散方法5倍的合成加速。

Conclusion: ARAS增强了缺陷真实感、保留了细粒度材料纹理，并提供了对合成异常的连续语义控制。此外，QARAD框架在多个基准数据集上表现出更优的性能。

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in anomaly synthesis methods, existing
diffusion-based and coarse inpainting pipelines commonly suffer from structural
deficiencies such as micro-structural discontinuities, limited semantic
controllability, and inefficient generation. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce ARAS, a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis
approach that precisely injects local, text-specified defects into normal
images via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated
auto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked
sampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves
fine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over
synthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly
Detection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy
that emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text
similarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three
benchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD
outperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection
tasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup
compared to diffusion-based alternatives. Our complete code and synthesized
dataset will be publicly available.

Motivation: 当前将口语数学表达转换成LaTeX的研究较少，但这一任务在教育和科研领域有具体应用需求。

Method: 论文利用自动语音识别（ASR）后修正模型、少量样例提示以及音频语言模型进行处理。

Result: 在MathSpeech基准测试中，方程转换的字符错误率（CER）为28%（相比之下，标准模型为30%），在提出的S2L方程基准测试中，模型性能超出MathSpeech模型40多个百分点（27%对比64%）。

Conclusion: 本文介绍了一种将口头数学表达式转化为LaTeX格式的解决方案，通过开发开源的大规模数据集和多种模型，使得在数学内容识别方面取得了显著的进展。

Abstract: Conversion of spoken mathematical expressions is a challenging task that
involves transcribing speech into a strictly structured symbolic representation
while addressing the ambiguity inherent in the pronunciation of equations.
Although significant progress has been achieved in automatic speech recognition
(ASR) and language models (LM), the problem of converting spoken mathematics
into LaTeX remains underexplored. This task directly applies to educational and
research domains, such as lecture transcription or note creation. Based on ASR
post-correction, prior work requires 2 transcriptions, focuses only on isolated
equations, has a limited test set, and provides neither training data nor
multilingual coverage. To address these issues, we present the first fully
open-source large-scale dataset, comprising over 66,000 human-annotated audio
samples of mathematical equations and sentences in both English and Russian,
drawn from diverse scientific domains. In addition to the ASR post-correction
models and few-shot prompting, we apply audio language models, demonstrating
comparable character error rate (CER) results on the MathSpeech benchmark (28%
vs. 30%) for the equations conversion. In contrast, on the proposed
S2L-equations benchmark, our models outperform the MathSpeech model by a
substantial margin of more than 40 percentage points, even after accounting for
LaTeX formatting artifacts (27% vs. 64%). We establish the first benchmark for
mathematical sentence recognition (S2L-sentences) and achieve an equation CER
of 40%. This work lays the groundwork for future advances in multimodal AI,
with a particular focus on mathematical content recognition.

Motivation: 传统的野生动物密度估计方法如捕捉-重捕获法、距离抽样法或相机陷阱虽然成熟但耗时或空间受限，研究寻求一种更高效、无干扰的方法。

Method: 使用无人机搭载热成像(IR)和RGB摄像头进行动物计数。调查使用了三种外推方法：简单的基于面积的外推、引导法和零膨胀负二项建模。同时也使用了相机陷阱数据通过随机相遇模型进行比较。

Result: 无人机方法结果与相机陷阱的随机相遇模型估计结果相似，但一般显示更高的密度，展示了无人机在开放和森林地区白天活动的密度，而随机相遇模型反映更长时间的平均活动。

Conclusion: 无人机提供了一种有前途的、可扩展的野生动物密度估计方法。

Abstract: We use unmanned aerial drones to estimate wildlife density in southeastern
Austria and compare these estimates to camera trap data. Traditional methods
like capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established
but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB
imagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys
were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and
November 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape.
Flight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and
an algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects.
This setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones,
minimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing
roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually
annotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square
kilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity:
naive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative
binomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was
calculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based
methods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM,
except in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects
daytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average
activity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches
estimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our
results show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife
density estimation.

TL;DR: 研究了扩展的迷因匹配方法，提出新方法在非模板迷因上表现优异，并指出需要更先进匹配技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法假设每个网络迷因都有一个共享视觉背景（模板）和叠加文本，这限制了迷因匹配仅比较背景图像。当前方法无法有效分析非模板迷因，也无法将迷因链接到网络迷因词典。

Method: 提出了扩展的迷因匹配方法，不局限于模板匹配。采用了一种新的基于分段的相似性量度计算，并尝试使用预训练的多模态大型语言模型进行迷因匹配。

Result: 新的分段相似性计算方法在非模板迷因匹配上表现优于整体图像匹配。

Conclusion: 准确的迷因匹配仍然是一个开放挑战，需要更复杂的匹配技术。

Abstract: Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in
how users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain
insight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated
content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other
memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called
Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,
most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual
background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme
matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude
the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of
automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to
contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader
formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show
that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise
computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes
but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the
segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image
measures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a
prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for
meme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared
visual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that
requires more sophisticated matching techniques.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效的机器学习管道用于从稀疏建筑分布的乡村地图中提取建筑特征，验证显示该方法性能优异并揭示了历史建筑遗址。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该论文旨在解决通过机器学习技术从历史地图中提取建筑足迹的过程中遇到的问题，尤其是对农村地区的大规模研究分析存在挑战。

Method: 提出一种层次化的机器学习方法，利用卷积神经网络（CNN）分类器初步筛选不太可能存在建筑的地图区域，然后对剩余高概率区域使用CNN分割算法以提取建筑特征。

Result: 通过对爱尔兰军械测量局的历史地图进行验证，该方法表现出高性能和较高效率，并识别出一个建筑群，这些建筑在1839年制作的地图中存在但在1899年的地图中缺失，暗示可能在大饥荒期间被遗弃。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了建筑特征提取的效率和准确性，还为历史和考古发现提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Historical maps offer a valuable lens through which to study past landscapes
and settlement patterns. While prior research has leveraged machine learning
based techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such
approaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally
intensive. This presents a challenge for research questions requiring analysis
across extensive rural regions, such as verifying historical census data or
locating abandoned settlements. In this paper, this limitation is addressed by
proposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse
building distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine
learning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are
first used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain
buildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The
remaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation
algorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test
sections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6
inch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency
compared to conventional segmentation-only approaches. Application of the
technique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights
its potential for historical and archaeological discovery. Notably, the
pipeline identified a settlement of approximately 22 buildings in Tully, Co.
Galway, present in the 6 inch map, produced in 1839, but absent from the 25
inch map, produced in 1899, suggesting it may have been abandoned during the
Great Famine period.

Result: 在四个基准（包括二分图像分割、伪装对象检测、海洋动物分割和遥感显著性检测）上的广泛实验显示该方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: SAM2-UNeXT通过集成新的编码器和简化架构显著提升了分割任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of adapting the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) for various downstream tasks. However, constructing a more
powerful and generalizable encoder to further enhance performance remains an
open challenge. In this work, we propose SAM2-UNeXT, an advanced framework that
builds upon the core principles of SAM2-UNet while extending the
representational capacity of SAM2 through the integration of an auxiliary
DINOv2 encoder. By incorporating a dual-resolution strategy and a dense glue
layer, our approach enables more accurate segmentation with a simple
architecture, relaxing the need for complex decoder designs. Extensive
experiments conducted on four benchmarks, including dichotomous image
segmentation, camouflaged object detection, marine animal segmentation, and
remote sensing saliency detection, demonstrate the superior performance of our
proposed method. The code is available at

Motivation: 雷达人为姿态估计是一种隐私保护且不受光照影响的感知方式，但受到噪声和多路径影响。

Method: 引入RadProPoser，这是一个概率编码解码架构，运用复杂值雷达张量进行处理，采用变分推理预测关键点，通过高斯和拉普拉斯分布探索概率表述。

Result: 在新的数据集上，RadProPoser的MPJPE为6.425厘米，45度角时为5.678厘米。学到的不确定性与实际姿态误差一致，最佳配置的预期校准误差为0.021。数据增强提高活动分类F1得分到0.870。

Conclusion: 这是第一个基于雷达张量的端到端HPE系统，能够从雷达数据建模和量化每个关节的不确定性，为雷达应用中的人体运动分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: Radar-based human pose estimation (HPE) provides a privacy-preserving,
illumination-invariant sensing modality but is challenged by noisy,
multipath-affected measurements. We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic
encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a
compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational
inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26
three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric
uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore
different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace
distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset
with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean
per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree
aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual
pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals,
with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021.
As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions
enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification,
resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first
end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify
per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for
explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.

Conclusion: MetaScope通过结合物理光学信息构建神经网络模型，为金属透镜内窥镜提供了强大的图像分割和修复能力，成功填补了金属透镜在数据采集和算法研究中的空白。

Abstract: Miniaturized endoscopy has advanced accurate visual perception within the
human body. Prevailing research remains limited to conventional cameras
employing convex lenses, where the physical constraints with millimetre-scale
thickness impose serious impediments on the micro-level clinical. Recently,
with the emergence of meta-optics, ultra-micro imaging based on metalenses
(micron-scale) has garnered great attention, serving as a promising solution.
However, due to the physical difference of metalens, there is a large gap in
data acquisition and algorithm research. In light of this, we aim to bridge
this unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we
establish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical
simulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to
strong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven
neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics.
MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment
(OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and
Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by
learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF)
distributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided
distillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also
achieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in object detection rely on modular architectures with
multi-scale fusion and attention mechanisms. However, static fusion heuristics
and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with
occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware
Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three
innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively
refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual
dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial
responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature
adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for
rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related
architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines,
DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95
across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed
datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M
parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale
variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust
solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and
autonomous systems.

Conclusion: CloudBreaker的表现表明，它是解决多光谱数据不可用或不可靠问题的一个有前途的解决方案。

Abstract: Cloud cover and nighttime conditions remain significant limitations in
satellite-based remote sensing, often restricting the availability and
usability of multi-spectral imagery. In contrast, Sentinel-1 radar images are
unaffected by cloud cover and can provide consistent data regardless of weather
or lighting conditions. To address the challenges of limited satellite imagery,
we propose CloudBreaker, a novel framework that generates high-quality
multi-spectral Sentinel-2 signals from Sentinel-1 data. This includes the
reconstruction of optical (RGB) images as well as critical vegetation and water
indices such as NDVI and NDWI.We employed a novel multi-stage training approach
based on conditional latent flow matching and, to the best of our knowledge,
are the first to integrate cosine scheduling with flow matching. CloudBreaker
demonstrates strong performance, achieving a Frechet Inception Distance (FID)
score of 0.7432, indicating high fidelity and realism in the generated optical
imagery. The model also achieved Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of
0.6156 for NDWI and 0.6874 for NDVI, indicating a high degree of structural
similarity. This establishes CloudBreaker as a promising solution for a wide
range of remote sensing applications where multi-spectral data is typically
unavailable or unreliable

Conclusion: 提出的evTransFER框架在事件驱动的面部表情识别任务上表现出色，实现了显著的准确性提升。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that asynchronously
capture per-pixel intensity changes with microsecond latency, high temporal
resolution, and high dynamic range, providing valuable information about the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the scene. In the present work, we propose
evTransFER, a transfer learning-based framework and architecture for face
expression recognition using event-based cameras. The main contribution is a
feature extractor designed to encode the spatio-temporal dynamics of faces,
built by training an adversarial generative method on a different problem
(facial reconstruction) and then transferring the trained encoder weights to
the face expression recognition system. We show that this proposed transfer
learning method greatly improves the ability to recognize facial expressions
compared to training a network from scratch. In addition, we propose an
architecture that incorporates an LSTM to capture longer-term facial expression
dynamics, and we introduce a new event-based representation, referred to as
TIE, both of which further improve the results. We evaluate the proposed
framework on the event-based facial expression database e-CK+ and compare it to
state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed framework
evTransFER achieves a 93.6\% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database,
significantly improving the accuracy (25.9\% points or more) when compared to
state-of-the-art performance for similar problems.

Search framework for efficient 6DoF object pose estimation. Estimating 3D
rotation and translation from a single image has been widely investigated yet
remains computationally demanding, limiting applicability in
resource-constrained scenarios. FPG-NAS addresses this by proposing a
specialized differentiable NAS approach for 6DoF pose estimation, featuring a
task-specific search space and a differentiable gating mechanism that enables
discrete multi-candidate operator selection, thus improving architectural
diversity. Additionally, a FLOPs regularization term ensures a balanced
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The framework explores a vast search
space of approximately 10\textsuperscript{92} possible architectures.
Experiments on the LINEMOD and SPEED+ datasets demonstrate that FPG-NAS-derived
models outperform previous methods under strict FLOPs constraints. To the best
of our knowledge, FPG-NAS is the first differentiable NAS framework
specifically designed for 6DoF object pose estimation.

Motivation: 从稀疏的2D视图重建和语义解释3D场景仍然是计算机视觉中的一个基本挑战，而传统方法通常将语义理解与重建脱钩或需要昂贵的逐场景优化，限制了其可扩展性和通用性。

Method: 本文提出的Uni3R框架通过一个跨视图Transformer整合来自多个视图的信息，并回归具有语义特征场的3D高斯原语。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Uni3R框架在多个基准测试中实现了新的最先进水平，为通用化、统一的3D场景重建和理解提供了新的范式。

Abstract: Reconstructing and semantically interpreting 3D scenes from sparse 2D views
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods often
decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly
per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and
generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward
framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched
with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our
approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information
across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian
primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation
facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic
segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art
across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on
ScanNet. Our work signifies a novel paradigm towards generalizable, unified 3D
scene reconstruction and understanding. The code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 估计物体的姿态和完整形状，而无需已知的3D模型或类别。

Method: 提出OmniShape，通过将形状完成解耦为两种多模态分布，并训练条件扩散模型来实现概率性的姿态和形状估计。

Result: OmniShape在处理真实世界数据集时表现出色。

Conclusion: OmniShape是首个能够通过概率性方法估计物体姿态和形状的技术。

Abstract: We would like to estimate the pose and full shape of an object from a single
observation, without assuming known 3D model or category. In this work, we
propose OmniShape, the first method of its kind to enable probabilistic pose
and shape estimation. OmniShape is based on the key insight that shape
completion can be decoupled into two multi-modal distributions: one capturing
how measurements project into a normalized object reference frame defined by
the dataset and the other modelling a prior over object geometries represented
as triplanar neural fields. By training separate conditional diffusion models
for these two distributions, we enable sampling multiple hypotheses from the
joint pose and shape distribution. OmniShape demonstrates compelling
performance on challenging real world datasets. Project website:

TL;DR: Veila是一种新的条件扩散框架，通过结合多种机制提高了LiDAR数据生成的性能和一致性，助力自动驾驶和机器人技术的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LiDAR数据生成方法或不具备良好的可控性，或缺乏细粒度空间控制。利用单目RGB图像作为空间控制信号能提供一种可扩展且低成本的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种新的条件扩散框架 Veila，该框架集成了信心感知条件机制（CACM）、几何跨模态对齐（GCMA）和全景特征一致性（PFC）。

Result: Veila在nuScenes、SemanticKITTI以及KITTI-Weather基准测试上表现出色，并提高了LiDAR语义分割的性能。

Conclusion: Veila在LiDAR数据生成的保真度和跨模态一致性方面达到了最先进的水平，并促进了通过生成数据增强提升后续LiDAR语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Realistic and controllable panoramic LiDAR data generation is critical for
scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods
either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt
text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a
monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost
alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core
challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially,
complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB
appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion;
and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic
LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and
LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional
diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism
(CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and
depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal
Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a
Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency
across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two
metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to
evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes,
SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila
achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency,
while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR
semantic segmentation.

Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在LiDAR生成方面虽然达到了高保真度，但缺乏对前景物体和空间关系的显式控制，这限制了其在场景模拟和安全验证中的应用。

Method: 提出了一种大型布局引导的LiDAR生成模型，称为“La La LiDAR”，该模型通过引入语义增强的场景图扩散和关系感知的上下文条件进行结构化LiDAR布局生成，并随后注入前景感知控制以进行完整的场景生成。

Result: La La LiDAR模型在LiDAR生成和下游感知任务中的性能达到了最先进的水平，并为可控的3D场景生成建立了新的基准。

Conclusion: La La LiDAR模型实现了最先进的LiDAR生成和下游感知任务性能，建立了可控3D场景生成的新基准。

Abstract: Controllable generation of realistic LiDAR scenes is crucial for applications
such as autonomous driving and robotics. While recent diffusion-based models
achieve high-fidelity LiDAR generation, they lack explicit control over
foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting their usefulness for
scenario simulation and safety validation. To address these limitations, we
propose Large-scale Layout-guided LiDAR generation model ("La La LiDAR"), a
novel layout-guided generative framework that introduces semantic-enhanced
scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for
structured LiDAR layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control
injection for complete scene generation. This enables customizable control over
object placement while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency. To support
our structured LiDAR generation, we introduce Waymo-SG and nuScenes-SG, two
large-scale LiDAR scene graph datasets, along with new evaluation metrics for
layout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that La La LiDAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both LiDAR generation and downstream perception
tasks, establishing a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation.

Conclusion: LiDARCrafter在数据增强和仿真方面取得了最先进的性能，提供了高保真度、可控性和时序一致性。

Abstract: Generative world models have become essential data engines for autonomous
driving, yet most existing efforts focus on videos or occupancy grids,
overlooking the unique LiDAR properties. Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic
4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence,
and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified
framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language
inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a
tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion
trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and
fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates
temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support
standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse
metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on
the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation
and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在短片生成上有效，但难以扩展至超长视频，存在时间不一致和视觉退化的问题。

Method: 提出LongVie，一种端到端自回归框架，通过统一噪声初始化和全球控制信号归一化策略保证时间一致性，并采用多模态控制框架和降级感知训练策略以减轻视觉退化。

Result: LongVie实现了长距离可控性、一致性和质量上的最新性能表现。

Conclusion: LongVie通过其创新设计解决了超长视频生成中的关键问题，实现了稳定、高质量的视频生成。

Abstract: Controllable ultra-long video generation is a fundamental yet challenging
task. Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to
scale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In
this paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate
noise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the
limitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose
LongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video
generation. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:
1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation
across clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces
alignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual
degradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates
both dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,
complemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively
balances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality. We also
introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100
high-resolution videos spanning diverse real-world and synthetic environments,
each lasting over one minute. Extensive experiments show that LongVie achieves
state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, consistency, and
quality.

Conclusion: Trokens方法通过将轨迹点转换为语义感知的关系令牌，结合运动和外观特征，提升了少样本动作识别的性能，在多个基准测试中取得了领先的效果。

Abstract: Video understanding requires effective modeling of both motion and appearance
information, particularly for few-shot action recognition. While recent
advances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action
recognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points
to track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a
novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational
tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling
strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and
semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that
captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented
Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action
patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with
semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action
recognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits),
Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym. For project page see

TL;DR: READ是首个实时音频驱动的说话人头像生成框架，通过使用异步噪声调度器和压缩的语音及视频隐空间，显著提高了生成速度和视频质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在音频驱动的说话人头像生成领域取得了重大进展，但推理速度极其缓慢，严重限制了其实际应用。为了解决这一问题，研究者提出了一个实时的说话人头像生成框架。

Method: 提出了一种利用时间VAE学习时空高度压缩视频隐空间的方法；设计了一种预训练的Speech Autoencoder用于生成与视频隐空间对应的时空压缩语音隐码。随后，使用精心设计的音频到视频扩散变压器（A2V-DiT）主干对这些隐含表示进行建模。此外，设计了一种新的异步噪声调度器，用于训练和推理过程，以确保时序一致性和加速推理。

Result: READ生成的说话人头像视频在质量和速度之间实现了最佳平衡，并在长时间生成中保持稳健的指标稳定性，实验结果表明其性能优于最先进的其他方法。

Conclusion: READ框架通过引入异步噪声调度器等技术，实现了无与伦比的实时音频驱动的说话人头像生成，其性能优于现有的最先进方法，大幅缩短了运行时间。

Abstract: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the
field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow
inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based
talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first
real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our
approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via
a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate
generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed
latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to
generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video
latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully
designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient
talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and
accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous
noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our
framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous
motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated
video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with
significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and
speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.
